- chunk size
  - need to iterate with chunk size 
  - make sure chunks only contain one topic; avpid 2+ topics per chunk 
  - ditto for overlap 
  

20231211 - genAI in genomics, Broad Retreat 
- panelists
  - caroline uhler. escml
    - use models to figure out what the netx best experiment is to do 
    - experiment: dall-e will always generate a clear ski when asked for a picture of a free ice cream truck 
  - alex rives, future fellow
   - lang models for biology (not text), focus on protein sequences 
   - models learn structure and funtion 
   - use models to learn what s not influendced by our bias 
  - david sontag, layer health 
    - predict treatmenr response based on patient data
    - single cell data, not enough data for ny one disease (200 samples) 
- notes
  - challenge on cost of training models 
    - ds: for single cell genomics, big models are not necessarily usefule
      - ei, cell type classification 
    - ar: scaling hypothesis: as scale models, add capabilties 
      - about $100 million per model, trending towards $1B 
      - with proteins, first saw that new models were not necessarily that much beter than simple models 
        - nbut gets better as you add in more diverse data 
        - biology still behind the curve 
        - eventually with lots of data, get more from unsupervised model on lots of data than trained (superviased?) model on less data 
        - ghenomic LLM, 1B param scale 
    - cu: when params > samples, then lose ways to generalize -> old way of thinking 
      - but not true with LLM models (lots of params); as increase params++, generaliztion error comes back down 
  - predictions for 5 years : 
    - ds: chart review
      - will also get to where clinical text better understood by LLM than people 
    - cu: multi modality, integration will provide extra insights 
    - ar: feature length film generated by AI
      - universal translator 
      - undersyand animal speech 
      - be able to read the fundamental language of biology 
        - generate biological systems and cells 
    - cu: imlpprtant to train new researchers that know both biology and AI 



- lookup 
  - are foundation models llms?


- prize recipeint 
- use SVD to decompose disease/variant matrix 
  - find common pathways used by the diseases 
  - genetic association similarity ptwhays 
- but 
  - disease/pathway/tissue/gene/variant data 
  - 90% loci are non coding in gwas 
  - too many variants in likage disequilibrkum 
  - gwas causal variants are hihjliy enriched in regulatory regions 
  - other methods to find causal variant from non coding data 
    - epimap
    - abc model 
    - but now use single cell data for better method 
      - SCENT (single celkl enhancer target gene mapping)
        - fimnds causal regulatory variant and the causal gene 
      - for RA, found RBPJ gene sing t-cell single cell data 



20220512 - viz.ai talk 
- 
- some people have different blood vessels in the briain
- ml process 
  - get scan of head 
  - reorient at tope
  - take out cranial using contrast filtering algorithm
  - filter to only see blood vessrels
  - see where the obstruction is due to where brain dye color travelled 
- 2 to 1 dev to ai staff 
- even if et 95% of psoitive cases, if you get a few false positives when most are negative, 
  can wake up physician too many times for false alarm -> problem 
- tail iof AI is longer to get to mature product because need to retrain 
  - not so for software, as bugs decrease over time 



20210414 - mit alphafold 2 talk

- history
  - 2013 is when ML really started helping with the protein folding problem
  - based on casp meetings 

- notes
  - transformers tend to be data hungry 
  - model predicts distance matrices that then are crunched into 3d structure
