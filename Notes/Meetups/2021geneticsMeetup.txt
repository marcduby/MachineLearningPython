  â€œMeaningful interpretations of deep neural networks to learn immune cell differentiation"
- 100 types of immune cell types 
- for each region
  - is ths a regulatory region?
  - which cell type is the region active in
- ML model 
  - input is sequence 
  - trains on activity across cell types 
    - use continuous data for relatory expression
  - goal is not to predict, but to understand
    - data is mostly complete 
  - why NN?
    - complex non linear models do well 
  - results is that most cell types have lots pof shared sequences, 
    but only a few distinct regions
    - so use loss function that focuses on these defferentiated regions so not get lost in model 
  - trainedx on mouse data, but then ran human sequences and got ok results 
    - make 10% accurate predictions 
  - for training, should you give each cell type equal weight
    - some lineages underrepresented
    - could equal weight by lineage

- so what did the NN learn?
  - can remove feature from the data, retrian and see how influencial that feature was to predictions 
  - for each region, how many motifs are needed to make a prediction?

- cam (conv additive moidel) 
  - each model has one conv filter and one fully connected layer
  - then added together 
  - use this for better explainability
    - can easily null out layer 

- challenges for prediction on newly seen sequences
  - not 5 motifs working together on hundreds of sites 
    - actually 5 motifs working together on a handful of sites
  - sparsity of data a problem for training 
  - if predicting subtle differences, harder

1200 - invest in drug discovery
- investment
  - question: invest in people or platform
  - novo focuses on target, but platforms are taking center stage
    - look at new ML platform, $5 billion
  - beyer
    - invest in the horde or the jockey
    - oean more to invest in tech and into
    - also look at agriculture and sustainability
    - don't look at profits at start, just focus on technology first 
  - new enterprise associates (asia)
    - data is key 
  - host:
    - the most competitive market for talent 
    - also new integration of data science, programming 


1430 - manufactiruing 
- gilead 
  - different producing small molecules in thousand gallon drums
    - vs cell therapy which is individual to the customer, measured in vein to vein time 
  - 3 pandemics last decade
    - aids  1980s
      - 38 million living with hiv, over 90% in developing world 
    - h1n1 2009
    - covid19, 2020, 2.4 million death toll after 14 months from initial outbreak 
- ionis 
- novo nordisk 
  - moved most of discovery from norway to cambridge ma 
- gsk, using functional genomics and ML for drug discovery 
  - 90% of medicines that enter 3 phase study fail (usually fail in phase 2)
  - mouse models have lmited value 
  - gwas studies are like randomizd trials 
    - can predict effect bp lowering effect of a variant 
    = can then predict if that lower bp helped with lower cvd 
  - can also use phewas 
    - assoc of phenotypes acorss genome with one genetic variant 
  - we only what to do with 15% of variants identified in gwas 
    - whoever cracks challenge of functional genomics will crack lots of diseases 
    - ex: rs12916, hdl 
      - 
    - use ML and functional genomics to look at gene/gene interactions 
  - crispr functional studies 
    - can do knockouts in gene by gene array for all 20k genes at once 
      - measure cell viability and fitness
      - can see if 2 genes knocked out today have bigger signal than barely alone
  - take high dimensional data from genomics + other omics and use ML to unravel betst possible targets 

- genentech 
  - cosinder 20% of 20k genes are druggable
    - 1k drugged so far 
  - how AI makes medicines faster 
    - needed for drug design 
    - depends on placing the right bets 
  - sees beginning of new era in drug discovery and healthcare 
  - for students 
    - chemists and biologists need to speak samde knowledge 
      - need data 
  - boom in tech helps in sorting more compounds on harder targets, make higher quality medicines
