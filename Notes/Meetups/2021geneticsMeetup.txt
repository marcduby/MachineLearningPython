- regeneron genome center 
  - commited to sequencing 7 million samples 
  
- notes 
  - for poligenic risk score, mostly use common variants with sorinkling of high effect rare variants 
  - for cost effective sequencing, so exome with imputation with some gwas as well 
    - key is to be able to automate the processing by robots 
  - get increased results with assaying samples with exomes and umputation (samer cost)
    - get a little better results with whoel sequencing, but at a much larger cost 

- sardinia study on BCL11A persistent fetal hemoglobin 
  - fetal hemoglobin is for womb and newborns to better exchange oxygen from host mother 
    - turned off in adulthood to other type if hemoglobin 
  - for heterogizous variant, were resistmt to malaria, which is why high concentration of variant in sardinia 
  - but have serious bad phenotype if homozygous 
  - eventually, led to vertex sycle cell breathrpugh 

- covid genetics study 
  - saw ACE2 prmoter signal 
    - if had this variant, had 40% lower infection and 40% percent lower hospitaliztion 

- use stringent pvalye 5e-08 gor gene using burden test 
  - get fewer signals, but theyr are more interesting 
    

- lookm up 
  - fetal hemoglobin 
  - how sardinia gwas study led to sickle cell breakthough 

20220425 - stanford drug discovery 
- r&d talk #1
  - servier 
    - opebning boston office
    - reorg
    - mostly oncology/neuro, looking at small molecule and monoclonal antibodies 
    - primary product Tibsovo, IDH1 inhibitor
    - bought shire 
  - merck 
    - even largest study 
  - amgen 
    - use human genetics to seelct targets
    - 4 waves of transformative innovations 
    - hard to make drugs for transriptive factors due to not many sites for binding 
      - could be overcome by multispecificty 
      - PRMT5 example (enzyme needed for cancer to grow)
      - most cancer cells have metabolite MTA is present; it down regulates PRMT5
      - find a moleule that n;y binds PRMT5 when MTA is present 




20220420 - mit sv nn talk
- building images from 2 read sections of the genome 
  - one for each axis 
  - relation of position of each section to each other is a hyperparameter of the nn
    - distance depends on the type of sv and sizes we are trying to identify
  - from the 2d image, use cnn 
  - get different channels from each sv type 

-  cheat sheet
  - het - heterozygous
  - hom - homozygous
  - inv - inversion
  - del - deletion 
  - dup - duplication 
  - tra - translaocation 
  

- model 
  - 4 layer stacked hourglass network 
  - hourglass modeul
    - does post processing using residual layer 
  - look at newell 2016 arch for human pose estimation paper 
  - fix the input image size to 256x256
    - change resolution of section size to pixel (hyperparameter?)
  - the section map to pixel translator function is designed for each sequencing platform 

- misc 
  - cost diff between short and long read sequencing 
    - not all software can handle long reads 



20220407 - deerfield presentation
- eeroms's law of drug developmeny costs
 - about $1B to $2.5B for druge discovery 
 - about 1.3% of gene tartget idea to success 
 - antobody progs more successful than small molecule 
 - supporting genetic evidence leads to 2.5x higher success rate from phase 1 to 3 success
   - also most prescribed drugs (53%)
   - 6 of 7 top grossing drugs 
- open targets, locus to gene score 
- best data 
  - OMIM, genebass
    - LoF inportant
    - GoF not very significant 
  - intogen for somatic/cancer
- gwas 
  - can't find anotation that makes gene hit better target 
  - as gwas grows, number of genes associated with traits increases, hence conundrum 
  - as gwas get better, the number of loci doesn't increase as fast as the strength ofg the existing signals 
- symptom managing drug more likely to have alternate rx uses
  - diease managing 1 use 
  - the less appaorved uses of drug, the more genetic evidence 
    - the more, the less
- mAb - monoclonal anti body


- lookl at
  - if drug approved used for different traits, look how similar traits are 




20211025 - NN in cell types (sara mostafavi)

  â€œMeaningful interpretations of deep neural networks to learn immune cell differentiation"
- 100 types of immune cell types 
- for each region
  - is ths a regulatory region?
  - which cell type is the region active in
- ML model 
  - input is sequence 
  - trains on activity across cell types 
    - use continuous data for relatory expression
  - goal is not to predict, but to understand
    - data is mostly complete 
  - why NN?
    - complex non linear models do well 
  - results is that most cell types have lots pof shared sequences, 
    but only a few distinct regions
    - so use loss function that focuses on these defferentiated regions so not get lost in model 
  - trainedx on mouse data, but then ran human sequences and got ok results 
    - make 10% accurate predictions 
  - for training, should you give each cell type equal weight
    - some lineages underrepresented
    - could equal weight by lineage

- so what did the NN learn?
  - can remove feature from the data, retrian and see how influencial that feature was to predictions 
  - for each region, how many motifs are needed to make a prediction?

- cam (conv additive moidel) 
  - each model has one conv filter and one fully connected layer
  - then added together 
  - use this for better explainability
    - can easily null out layer 

- challenges for prediction on newly seen sequences
  - not 5 motifs working together on hundreds of sites 
    - actually 5 motifs working together on a handful of sites
  - sparsity of data a problem for training 
  - if predicting subtle differences, harder

1200 - invest in drug discovery
- investment
  - question: invest in people or platform
  - novo focuses on target, but platforms are taking center stage
    - look at new ML platform, $5 billion
  - beyer
    - invest in the horde or the jockey
    - oean more to invest in tech and into
    - also look at agriculture and sustainability
    - don't look at profits at start, just focus on technology first 
  - new enterprise associates (asia)
    - data is key 
  - host:
    - the most competitive market for talent 
    - also new integration of data science, programming 


1430 - manufactiruing 
- gilead 
  - different producing small molecules in thousand gallon drums
    - vs cell therapy which is individual to the customer, measured in vein to vein time 
  - 3 pandemics last decade
    - aids  1980s
      - 38 million living with hiv, over 90% in developing world 
    - h1n1 2009
    - covid19, 2020, 2.4 million death toll after 14 months from initial outbreak 
- ionis 
- novo nordisk 
  - moved most of discovery from norway to cambridge ma 
- gsk, using functional genomics and ML for drug discovery 
  - 90% of medicines that enter 3 phase study fail (usually fail in phase 2)
  - mouse models have lmited value 
  - gwas studies are like randomizd trials 
    - can predict effect bp lowering effect of a variant 
    = can then predict if that lower bp helped with lower cvd 
  - can also use phewas 
    - assoc of phenotypes acorss genome with one genetic variant 
  - we only what to do with 15% of variants identified in gwas 
    - whoever cracks challenge of functional genomics will crack lots of diseases 
    - ex: rs12916, hdl 
      - 
    - use ML and functional genomics to look at gene/gene interactions 
  - crispr functional studies 
    - can do knockouts in gene by gene array for all 20k genes at once 
      - measure cell viability and fitness
      - can see if 2 genes knocked out today have bigger signal than barely alone
  - take high dimensional data from genomics + other omics and use ML to unravel betst possible targets 

- genentech 
  - cosinder 20% of 20k genes are druggable
    - 1k drugged so far 
  - how AI makes medicines faster 
    - needed for drug design 
    - depends on placing the right bets 
  - sees beginning of new era in drug discovery and healthcare 
  - for students 
    - chemists and biologists need to speak samde knowledge 
      - need data 
  - boom in tech helps in sorting more compounds on harder targets, make higher quality medicines
