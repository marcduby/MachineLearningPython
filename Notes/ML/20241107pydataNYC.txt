- A+ - reference todo
- chunking strategies
  - fixed token 
  - recursive - break doc on line breaks then joins them until limit 
  - semantic - puts info together based on intent of senetence 
  - html/makdown/code - availavle in langchain and llamaindex 

- summarrization technoiches
  - map reduce 
    - create summary of each chunk
    - then use 3 summariess and creat a final one 
  - refine 
    - sequencially create summary and refine with next chun
    - generate first summary, then add next chiunk and create/refine new summary 

- fine tuning 
  - instructlab library oss
    - enables fine tuning of an existing LLM 
    - model agnostic 
    - create synthetic dataset for training just a few examp,es 
    - 

- evaluation 
  - overlap based 
  - semantic based 
  - LLM based 
    - exx: use mistral 7B for summarization, then use better model (mistral 13B) for evluatiohn

- question/answer generation (QAGs)
  - look at figure 

- G-eval 
  - see paper
  - steps 
    - task introduction
    - evaluation criteria 
    - evaluation steps 

- example of tech stacks 
  - model - mistral ai or ibm granite 
  - framework - langchain 
  - chunking
  - fine tuning - instruct lab 
  - deployment - red hat openshift 

- LLM life cycle and data floe 
  - see figure 

- takeways 
   - choose right mkdel for your use case 
   - account for text length *short or long)
   - document struxtures helps inform the chunking approach 
   - summarization tec hnique is based on requirement and doc structure 
   - for specialized output, look to fine tuned model 



20241107 - 1100 - explaing ML model using LLMs
- C
- SHAP 
  - takes any black box model and can find the contribution of each featture 




20241107 - 1000 - time series forecasting 
- B+ - reference todo
- github 
  - 

- sktime, skforecast - from scikit libs 
- sktime functions 
  - Detrender() -> removes trend of data so can see seasonality better 

- skforecast 
  - more limited furntionality compared to sktime 
  - but faster
  - expects data prep using pandas 


20241107 - 0900 - keynote first day 
- ai transformations
  - enrich employee work
  - reinvent customer
  - reshape business processes
  - product innovation

- azure ai templtae library 
  - deploy apps to azure using vs code or githubv actions 

- demo 
  - quart provises async in flask 

- azure 
   'azd up' command to get service up
   - uses bicep?
