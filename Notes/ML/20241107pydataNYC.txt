20241107 - 1605 - tuning the LLM transformer - MB 
- piano 
  - 3 pedals, 88 keys
  - music is a sequence of force, speed and length of key strike
  - can model this into time sequence of events 
    - MIDI format (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
    - can reporesent as dataframe of notes
      - each note 4 values (pitch, velocity - how loud, start, end)

- <BOS> input to llm here text <EOS>
  - used for regular next token prediction/training

- <MASK> is a great <MASK> today 
  - mask token prediction replacement
  - can use this to prpedict deleted parts of a musical sequence 

- pianoroll.io 
  - crowdsourcing for gathering enough piano data to train genAI model
    - got4 trained on 20+ trillion tokens
    - trying to get 31 10e6 notes, which would be 200 1-e6 tokens for LLM training  
  - they use GPT2 models


- do fine tuning of piano model to teach it better harmonics

20241107 - 1520 - faster pyspark with apache arrow - MB 
- regular python udf forces data serialization between jvm and python process
  - regular udf serializes using general pkl (pikle) format
  - arrow uses more efficient specialized format 




20241107 - 1430 - knowledge graphs AI, neo4j - CPW
- LLMs generate data, not knowledge 
- glaive AI fine tune of llama
- thursday ai pod, @ThursdAI_prod in twitter 
- neo4j  - uses proprerty graph model 
  - includdes graph data science 
  - queries in pattern matching

- graphRAG
  - differen from vector RAG 
  - adding knowledge graph relationships into the RAG 
  - so 
    - vector graphs
    - search and pattern matching
    - graph queriess

- construct knowledge grpah from unstructured text 
  - neo4j project to look at

20241107 - 1325 - trustworthy ai adoption in healthcare and LF 
- more than 55% women in europe die of CVD 
  - risk dramatically goes up after menopause
  - need to filter data for this artifact 
- ai has potential to amplify data bias 
- PA is removing all race based data for the care algorithm 
- mcinsey hel\alth institute study 
  - closing the women's health gap 

- ai equity

- eu has 5% of income penalty for misues/bad ai 
- ethicara  responsible AI tool in pfizer 
- sourcezs of ai bias
  - data/social bias 
  - algorithm bias 
- NYS 
  - any AI algoritthm that tpuches individual roghts (employment, etc) jhas to undergo bias testing

20241107 - 1140 - how to make better summaries unsing LLMs
- A+ - reference todo
- chunking strategies
  - fixed token 
  - recursive - break doc on line breaks then joins them until limit 
  - semantic - puts info together based on intent of senetence 
  - html/makdown/code - availavle in langchain and llamaindex 

- summarrization technoiches
  - map reduce 
    - create summary of each chunk
    - then use 3 summariess and creat a final one 
  - refine 
    - sequencially create summary and refine with next chun
    - generate first summary, then add next chiunk and create/refine new summary 

- fine tuning 
  - instructlab library oss
    - enables fine tuning of an existing LLM 
    - model agnostic 
    - create synthetic dataset for training just a few examp,es 
    - 

- evaluation 
  - overlap based 
  - semantic based 
  - LLM based 
    - exx: use mistral 7B for summarization, then use better model (mistral 13B) for evluatiohn

- question/answer generation (QAGs)
  - look at figure 

- G-eval 
  - see paper
  - steps 
    - task introduction
    - evaluation criteria 
    - evaluation steps 

- example of tech stacks 
  - model - mistral ai or ibm granite 
  - framework - langchain 
  - chunking
  - fine tuning - instruct lab 
  - deployment - red hat openshift 

- LLM life cycle and data floe 
  - see figure 

- takeways 
   - choose right mkdel for your use case 
   - account for text length *short or long)
   - document struxtures helps inform the chunking approach 
   - summarization tec hnique is based on requirement and doc structure 
   - for specialized output, look to fine tuned model 



20241107 - 1100 - explaing ML model using LLMs
- C
- SHAP 
  - takes any black box model and can find the contribution of each featture 




20241107 - 1000 - time series forecasting 
- B+ - reference todo
- github 
  - 

- sktime, skforecast - from scikit libs 
- sktime functions 
  - Detrender() -> removes trend of data so can see seasonality better 

- skforecast 
  - more limited furntionality compared to sktime 
  - but faster
  - expects data prep using pandas
