  - 

- study 
  - for brain 
    - 20k genes, 9k proteins 
  - a few hundred samp,es 
  - so do feature selection to reduce the 20k genes to a few hundred
  - then place network structure on top of the feature space 
  - then get graph neural network 
    - convolution on graphs through message passing 
      - graph convolution pulls informaTION FROM NEAREST NEIGHBORS OF NODES

- delvi project 
  - to help with electrica; congestion
  - issues with no new way t add new customers
- cache intermitent stage 
  - switch between DataFrame and LazyFrame (.lazy())

- recommendations
  - show, don't tell
  - use benchmarks to see how speed is improving from pandas to polars 
    - benchmark early
  - use polars lazy API 
  - "cache" to prevent double work 
  - fewer surprises in behavior from polars 
  - take baby steps
   join the community (discord server)

- results of converrsion
  - 20% reduction in time
  - 92% reduction in ram (40GB)
  - costs from $140k to #3.5k -> 98% 

- started for speed, but found API easier to work with than pandas 


20241107 - 1605 - tuning the LLM transformer - MB 
- piano 
  - 3 pedals, 88 keys
  - music is a sequence of force, speed and length of key strike
  - can model this into time sequence of events 
    - MIDI format (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
    - can reporesent as dataframe of notes
      - each note 4 values (pitch, velocity - how loud, start, end)

- <BOS> input to llm here text <EOS>
  - used for regular next token prediction/training

- <MASK> is a great <MASK> today 
  - mask token prediction replacement
  - can use this to prpedict deleted parts of a musical sequence 

- pianoroll.io 
  - crowdsourcing for gathering enough piano data to train genAI model
    - got4 trained on 20+ trillion tokens
    - trying to get 31 10e6 notes, which would be 200 1-e6 tokens for LLM training  
  - they use GPT2 models


- do fine tuning of piano model to teach it better harmonics

- huggigface.co/epr-labs 





20241107 - 1520 - faster pyspark with apache arrow - MB 
- regular python udf forces data serialization between jvm and python process
  - regular udf serializes using general pkl (pikle) format
  - arrow uses more efficient specialized format

20241107 - 1140 - how to make better summaries unsing LLMs
- A+ - reference todo
- chunking strategies
  - fixed token 
  - recursive - break doc on line breaks then joins them until limit 
  - semantic - puts info together based on intent of senetence 
  - html/makdown/code - availavle in langchain and llamaindex 

- summarrization technoiches
  - map reduce 
    - create summary of each chunk
    - then use 3 summariess and creat a final one 
  - refine 
    - sequencially create summary and refine with next chun
    - generate first summary, then add next chiunk and create/refine new summary 

- fine tuning 
  - instructlab library oss
    - enables fine tuning of an existing LLM 
    - model agnostic 
    - create synthetic dataset for training just a few examp,es 
    - 

- evaluation 
  - overlap based 
  - semantic based 
  - LLM based 
    - exx: use mistral 7B for summarization, then use better model (mistral 13B) for evluatiohn

- question/answer generation (QAGs)
  - look at figure 

- G-eval 
  - see paper
  - steps 
    - task introduction
    - evaluation criteria 
    - evaluation steps 

- example of tech stacks 
  - model - mistral ai or ibm granite 
  - framework - langchain 
  - chunking
  - fine tuning - instruct lab 
  - deployment - red hat openshift 

- LLM life cycle and data floe 
  - see figure 

- takeways 
   - choose right mkdel for your use case 
   - account for text length *short or long)
   - document struxtures helps inform the chunking approach 
   - summarization tec hnique is based on requirement and doc structure 
   - for specialized output, look to fine tuned model
