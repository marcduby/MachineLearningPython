1100 - google APIs by cyber web consulting 
- athn vs authz 
  - authentication vs authorization 
  - authz usually uses oauth2 for this purpose 
    - for APIs, need permission scope 
  
- 9 stes to gcp apis 
  - go to gogole cloud 
  - login to acct 
  - reate project (logical container for apps to use)
  - enable APIs to use 
  - enable billing 
  - download client libs 
  - create and download credentials 
  - write code (import client libs, create api aboject, use client to maker call)
  - run cod (may need to authorize)
- console.developers.google.com 
  - 3 main sections 
    - dashboard 
      - list of APIs turned on for the project 
    - library of available APIs
    - credentials tab 

- client libs 
  - 2 types of libs 
    - platform level -> might have to do more work, but easy to integrate pultiple prodicts
    - product level -> custom libs specific to one product 
- 3 credentia types 
  - simple -> api keys, tied to a project 
  - authorized -> oauth client ids (access data owned by user)
    - addtional security via OAuth2 
  - authoriZed -> servivce accounts (daat owned by app/robot user)
    - addtional security via OAuth2 


- serverless 
  - a lie: servers in the background but are completely abstracted away fromt he user 
  - fasteest growing segment -> $1.9B in 2016 to $14.93B 2023
  - good for autoscaling 
  - if code not running, no billing

1000 - kaggle ceo 
- research based changes 

- look into
  - lmsys leaderboard
    - chatbotarima 
  - notebookLM


- classic ml cycle
  - data collection -> data prep -> model training -> model eval -> serving 
- for genai cycle 
  - vanilla model foundation -> manual prompt engineering -> automated prompt tuning 
    -> context tools (RAG), reasoning loops -> model fine tuning -> train new foundation model 
  - paradigm is exact opposite of classic ml cycle 

- what models are good for 
  - lots of investment so far 
  - 
- pace of innovation in AI is the fastest of any tech ever 
- multi agent world most likely future 
  - easier to understand group of smaller task models as opposed to one big model 





20240910 - java for genAI - jacksonville
- 



20240122 - genai meetup
- $40 billion 2024 prediction, $80 for 2025
- 30% of working hours can be elimiminated/augmented 
- RAG is emerging framework 
  - keeps private data private


20220830 - ML kgalle 4 week course, tampa 
- process for data cleaing
  - find duplicate rows
  - find features with missing columns 
    - if too high % of missing, remove column
    - if low, replace values with mean (or somethign else)
    


20200730 - ml at AWS
- aws labeling services
  - manual labeling  
    - outside 250k people (mechanical turk)
    - or your staff (security)
  - after 1k pieces labeled, auto labeling gets triggered
- deep composer
  - GANs
    - airbus for plane parts

- supervised
  - every training example has a corresponding labeling
- unsupervised
  - no lables for the data; cluter based on 
-
  - learn from consequences of your actiopns
  


- todo
    - expectation maximization by Dawid and Skeen
    - look for paper
