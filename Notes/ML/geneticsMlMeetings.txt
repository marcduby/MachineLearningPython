genome dome at 160 - use of LLMs 
computation foundation models for computational pathology 
- FM does (nature medicine in March) 
  - vidual and text encoding 
  - multi modal fusion decoder 
  - 
raphael brosula, broad 
- AI can help worjk across data typess and generizable patient representations 
- FM trained on EHR 
- can extract insights from tge data 
- features that are measurenments reflect better the accuracy of patient
  - diagnosys not so 
  - number features can better inform over time 
mgh - genetics 
- clinical sequencing realm 
  - speeding litterature review in WGS interpretation 
  - evaluate varint pathogenicity 
  - issues: 
    - drift over time; so LLMs drift over time 
discussion 
- black women have 40% worse risk for good diagnosis
- models are trained on white women 
- temporal trends in ehr data 
- ehr changed during and after pandemic 
- only 1k south asian genomes so far 
  - trying ot grow it to 5k, will be largest in world 
- cancer: used dna bert 


genome dome at 1700 - AI in clinical practice 
dr romero, mayo clinic
- from data source to storage to data mining and preprocessing, feature engineering to model development to operational deployment 
- difference between applied AI and research AI 
  - research AI, focused on model development 
    - skills: comsci, stats 
  - applied AI, focused on clinical impact
    - skills: DS, infor atics, systems engineering
    - approach: 
      - system redesign
      - data quality
      - model sleection 
      - human compure su=ynergy 
      - change management - get people to use the model in their work  
      - measuring results 
  - teaching course - executive education course at HSPH 

hunlei xu, novartis 
- use of AI in clinical trials 
- genAI use 
  - help integrate EHR data and historical data 
  - compating studies 
- genAI can be golden hammer, but not everything is a nail 
Dr Tiwarei, wisco 
- reaesrch and use of AI for it 
disussion 
- mayo i referral center 
  - keeps patients that are complex enough 
- mayo also used AI to predict how many beds would be need in a week, month 
- mayo thinks model transparency is overrated 
  - not as interested how model got there, but interested in what variables are important 
    - also want accuracy 
  - for tabular data, XGboost and random forest work just as well if not better 
- want to train an dtst your model on data from different institutions 
- q: what about using AI to creen patients to use in clinical trials ?
  - and how to make sure to get peoolpe with differnt ethnic bacjgrounds 
  - in braim tumors, men have more chance of getting worse cancers 
    - so developed sex based models 
  - in cliniucal trial, use cost in identifying trial candidates (around 40%)
    - curent: people reading charts of patients to see which ones could be good candidates 
      - even with very formal inclusion/exclusion criteria, some patients make it through
    - genAI could drive cost of clinical trials 
    - but coud also use data filtering tools

  - genetic association data 
  - wet lab work using crispered human cells
- what changed for data in healthcare research 
  - got a lot more data o train models
    - lots of ehr data 
    - gentics data 
    - cell data using crispr
- as a founder 
  - important to boostrap a good culture, which then builds on itself as new generations of employees come in

20230419 - broad mia - AI research in biomedicine
- AI for antibiotic research 
  - problem with generative AI for antibiotics 
    - generates chem structures that are hard to synsethize
  - use monte carlo tree search to find easy to synsethize new antibiotics 
    - still very large search space 
    - so use antibiotic property predictor to score 
    - back propagate the score back up the tree to its fragments 
  - score balances 
    - efficacy, structural novelty, safety, synthesizability 
  - sent 70 recipes to Enamine in Ukraine, got 58 back (80% success)
    - test 58 aganst pathogens that have the most antibiotic escaping 
    - 6 escape pathogens have developed immunity to existing anitbiotics 
      - found 6 novel antibiotics that inhibit 4 of the 6 ESKAPE pathogens 
      - need drugs to work at low dosage 

- AI designed clinical trials 
  - way to design new clinical trial protocols 
  - clinicaltrials are the bottlenecks of dug discovery 
    - if more efficient, should help with drug success yield 
  - 40% cancer trials fail to reach minimum enrollment 
  - trail eligibility critera is often arbitrary 
  - use generative AI on EHR records to emulate traisl and guide design of new trials 
  


20230419 - broad mia - evaluatijng medical AI 
- ex: skin cancer photo identification 
  - ussiues with mislabeled data used for training (60%)
  - some ethnicity bias (20%)
  - use shapley score to evaluate traing data 
    - can also use to do synthetic data generation 

- ex: ejection fraction calculation for cardiologists 
  - from video, cardiologist measure contracted vs expanded chamber to calclate volume of pump 
  - replace by AI having video coupled with ekg 




20230405 - GNNs intro 
- can 
  - transform one graph into another with a funtction 
  - better graph built, better models you get 
  - how to build bad graphs? what to avoid 
  - move to richer graphs 
    - the more information, the better 
  - one brute force model - start with fully connected graph then let it decide which connections to keep 
  


20230322 - broad mia - images and omics predictions 
- notes 
  - advantage of getting data on cell profile without destroying it 
  - biomedical imaging as an alternative 
    - cheaper to produce than omics data 
  - how can images co,plement omics data 
  - so biomolecules meaured omics data also reflect/aborb light differently 
  - so in data, combine stain data with single cell omics data set 
  


20230308 - mia primer, autoencoders for genetics 

- notes 
  - autoencoders 
  - variational autenconders 
  - when combining different types of data in the input layer, make sure the data scale is the same 
  - swaping AAE for VAE 
    - get same performance 
    - AAE learned a different part of the data than the VAE 
    - if combine, then get improvement 
  - for VAE, need to pick input variables carefully 
    - normal NN will ignore extraneous vars 
    - VAE needs to rebuild all vars, so results skewed by unnecessary vars 
  - VAEs are stochastic, don't always give the same result when trained 
    - because of sdampling in the encoding step?
    - so need to run experiments multiple times on multiple trained models 

  - for t2d model 
    - trained model, then perturbed data to see what effect it has 

- notes for 2nd talk 
  - ROPE: region of practical equivalence 
  - for perturbation slide, the versicolor dataset if the perturbed one 
  






20230306 - schmidt center - de novo protein design, david baker 
- presenter 
  - david bake, https://www.bakerlab.org/
  - institute for protein design 

- notes 
  - use rosetta model 
    - but can also use deep leartning
  - more easy to design small proteins that bind to other large targets 
  - design protein that alters bound protein state when bound 
  - deep learning 
    - use reinforcement learning, monte carlo tree search 
  - custom model 
    - rosettafold
      - baek and dimaio 
      - second edition of model performed better by modifying loss function 
      - goes beyond proetein, but also dna 
      - now rosettafold can model any biomedical molecule system 
    - ligandMPNN, proteinMPNN

- ie:
  - take flu virus, point to binding section, then let diffusion process design a protein that binds to that area 
  




20230301 - ai in rradiology

  - predicitng p-p interaction 
    - identify a target site on protein for binding 
    - model motif based on site 
    - find matching motif for binding protein 
    - will find some sections where you can't mutate AA or else deleterious to binding  
      - no improvments to be made 

- 2nd talk 
  - if two proteins are near together in 3d space, they tend to mutate together

20230201 - mia meeting, brain hie, stanforcd - learning protein evolution 

- study genetic heritability in proteins by training ML
  - idea of dependencies of choice of amino acid in one position, influences choice of amino acid in other position 

- protein training models 
  - protein language models 
    - take protein sequence, mask 15% of sequnence and train model to predict maked sequneces 

- solve viral escape problem 
  - flu, hiv, covid 
  - viral escape can be caused by single amino acid change 
  - viral escape wants to keep binding of protein but change signature so host doesn't recognize the new virus 
  - maynard word game 
    - if want to mutate 'word' to word 'gene', but only one letter at a time and intermediate words need to be valid 

- approach 
  - train anguage models on sequences of amino acids 
  - some ML models predicted covid mutations before they became variations of concern 
  - protein language models learn evolutionary rules 

- for proteins 
  - fitness curve of the sequence across sequence space 
  - flu
    - evolves about one sequence a year ?
    - try to predict next evolution by models (evolutionary velocity)
    - models dont' assume selection pressure (from immunity)

- info 
  - serpins -> protein family 

- future 
  - testing antibody changes against future virus sequences 
    - also improve fitness of the antibody 
  - can also try to improve catalitic activity of an enzyme

- algorithms 
  - markov chain with monte carlo 
    - initialize random sequence x
    - loop for 50k generations
      - mutate x to x' 
      - calculate f(x') for new sequnece 
      - if f(x') is superior to f(x), replace x with x'
      - can also tolerate some drop in f(x') to account for escaping local maximum 
        - use random loss: bayesian loss?

- use deep protein ml models (alphafold)
  - but define your own fitness functions 
    - get different resuklts 
    - do find some sequences that exist in nature 
    - hie, candido 2022 bioRxiv

- evolution of viruses go hand in hand with evolution of the hosts 
  - not well understood, but could use ML models to understand better 

- papers 


- models 
  - DeepSequence 
    - mostly one sequnece change at a time?


----------------------------------------------------------------------
20201208 - crispr ML
- base editing 
  - gores after cytisine 
  - avoids double starnd break, so avoid indels

- genetic bases 
  - purines have 2 rings, pyrimidines have one rings
  - so hard to convert between the two

- how specific is crispr gene editing
- dna repair outcomes from cas9 
- base editing outcomes 
  - base editing very efficient at point mutations 
  - poitions size of 4-6 nucletides 
- more base editor than crispr options (easier to create) 
- for wanted goal phenotype, could use multiple base editors 

- ML
  - 10k labeled inputs
    - use xgboosted tree 
  - deep conditiona; autoregressive model 
    - pass freq from previous position to next to predict next position
    - deeper decoder with more layers helped a lot

20180411 - MIA, protein folding problem
- simulation for protein structure
  - built around energetic optimization
    - folding goes from high energy state to low energy state
    
  - sequence -> energy landscape -> structure

- simulator for pretein structure
  - back propogation through time
    =- how to train your simulator
  - function for each pair of amino acids
    - start with a straint protein sequence, the end up with 3d model of the folding
    
  - energy -_ simulator -> protein structure + loss function
    - energy over time, so various steps to each simulator step
     
- protein folding important in designing medications

    
- terms
  - homology
    - the state of having the same or similar relation, relative position, or structure
    
  - RNN (recurring neural networks)
  - graph neural networks (used in 3d chemistry)
  - langevin dynamics (gradient descent with noise)
    - gradient descent process can turn chaotic after awhile; chaos causes not being to back propageta in time (used in learning)
      - ie: protein could start bouncing between multiple positions that can tend to go apart -> go into chaos, start getting meaningless numbers
        - perturbations in the system can become amplified by tthe syste itself
  - protein fold: arrangement of secondary structure elements
  


20171129 - 3d mapping of the human gehnome, prof aiden, Rice University
- dbna 2 meters long
- contac6t mapping
  - exploring structurer via proximity
    - for town, examine how residents co localize
    - for genome, use assays that measure dna/dna contacts in intact nuclei (nuclear ligation assay)
      - this contact maps the human genome
      
- Hi-C: 3d genome sequencing
- chroms in mamls are not extended, they occupy a very discrete volume

- 3d features have 1d codes
  - weak sense (correlation); there are 1d featres that enable you to predict hwo the genome will fld
  - strng sense (causation)
  
- some patterns/heat maps are close,ly correlated to open/close chrmatin
- loops in chromatin = peaks in contact map

- hi c map
  - 2d heat map, usually 400kb x 400 kb
  - some undercoverd sectionsm, so run some normalizations
  - so looks like contact matrix
  - usulally find 10k loops
  - observations
    - most loops are short, less than 2MB
    - a lot of loops are conserved accross cell types, and some species
      - some change
    - loops are anchored at convergent CTCF sites
      - 90% pointed at inward notation
    - hypothesis
      - 2 hooked donuts go up and down dna, and stop at stop signs (pointed in their direction), then get loop
      - extrusion enables prediction of loops
      - the convergent rule is a code in the strong sense
      - test: by editing single CTCF motifs, we can engineer loops
        - try using crispr, take out 20-100 bases of the human genome
        - by deleting tamdem CTCF sites, we can refold whole chromosomes
      - note: multiple groups have proposed interphae loop extrusion model
      - observation
        - if degrade cohesion, degrade all loops
        - just get single line heat map
        - use oxin to degrade the cohesion
          - if you withdraw the oxin, loops come back
          - looks lke the extrusion process slides at 400 bases per second
          
- what do loop domains do?
  - loops associated with gene activity
  - surpisingly, few genes are affected by the loss of cihesin

  - can also skip co-regulated genes (co-expressed)
    - common in bilogy

- housekeeping geens: genes that are on in every tissue
  - but there are ways (by expressed measurement) what tissue they came from
  
- helps to decompress high dimensioal signal

- note: a gene that might be oin a correlation group in ne cell type could be in naother correlation group in another cell type
- sparse mnf

    - model populations
      - k: # of populations
      - BETA k, l: dist of alleles for pop k at locus l
    - model
      - for each population, BETA k,l ~ distribution for each pop at each locus (4, 1, for each letter)
      - for each indix, THETAi ~ dir(ALPHA)   -> hidden vars
        - for each locus,
          - z(ilm) ~ THETAi,                  -> hidden
          - z(ilf) ~ THETAi                   -> hidden
          - y(ilm) ~ BETA z,l.m   -> observed
          - y(ilf) ~ BETA z,l.f   -> observed

- stochastic optimaiation
  - the drunk story
    - try to get from boston to LA, assuem everyone is drunk
    - ask person1 where LA is, walk 700 miles
    - ask person you run into, person2, where LA is, walk 350 miles into direction
    - repeat until get to LA
    - assumption is that if distro of person pointing to LA has mean as LA
  - in practice
    - smple indiv
    - update indiv params of pops assign and
    - pretend ths indiv is only person in pop
    - then ask what pop params would be for that
    - then set pop params 1/2 way between thsi and what pop params were
    - repeat

      - 3 node ex of dag (x1 -> x2, x1 -> x3, x2 -> x3), c is guassian noise
        - x1 = c1
        - x2 = @12 * x1 + c2
        - x3 = @13 * x1 + @23 * x2 + c3
- chromosome territories
  - interphase chromosomes coccupy distinct space
- find minimal configuration of ellipsoids
  - measure overlap by largest circle I can fit into the overlap
  - take norm as weak to avoid solution with a few large overtlaps
    - want distributed overlap
  - good way to determine chromosome territories
    - redict new neighbors as shape of container changes
    - put cell in different tissue, see how genes get reorganized
    - cell differentiatino and gene expressio
- highly expressed genes tend to be at the center of the nucleus
  - also the smaller ones
  - genes that are atthe overlap are co regulated and expressed
