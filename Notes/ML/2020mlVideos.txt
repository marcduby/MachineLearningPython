20210515 - testing ML models, PyCon 2021
- issues
  - how to run tests on a jupyter notebook
- test suite tools for ML
  - use the estimator and transformer classes
    - overload the predict(), fit() and transform() methods
  - also look at the Pipeline and FeatureUnions

- tools
  - use black for code formatting
  - ci/cd with jenkins
  - yellow brick project (best of sklearn and matplotlib)
    - helps with model selection and tuning 
- tips
  - set your random state for reproducibility 
  - use pytest.parameterize 
  - use pytest.approx function
  - precision vs recall vs f1 score 

- tips for m in general
  - wrap open soucre code, like yb to produce result + visual
  - use pipelines for consistency 
  - use parameterization where possible 
  - team wide conde consistency 
  - use ci/cd

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JntA9XaTebs
- https://github.com/tklouie/PyData_LA_2018

- models
  - ARIMA
  - facebook prophet
  - LSTM

- look at staionarity
    - most time series assume underlying time series data is stationary
    - this shows certain stats properrties and allows us to use some forecasting models

- split time series data into:
  - trend
  - seasnality
  - residual
