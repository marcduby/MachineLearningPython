- questions 
  - why can't all targets not be indcated by human genetics 

- vocabulary 
  - modalities of drugs: small molecule vs antibodies 
    - also rna, gene editing, si-rna, epigentic modifications of genes 


- novo nordisk 
  - targets, safety 
  - steps 
    - 1 - locus identification 
    - 2 - identify caudsal genes
      - just because top variant, not necessarily causeal variant  
    - 3 - deduce dirrection of effect 
    - 4 - use genetics to test for potential adverse effects and additional phewas indications
    - 5 - establish whether unknown gene has a ole in human disease (new experiments)
    - 6 - use 
    - 7 - explore drugability 

  - to identify causal gene 
    - gwas, epigenetic marker, rare variants, 
    - mendella  randomization 
      - gene expression in tissue, protein expression, metabolites, known risk factors 

  - pcsk9 example 
    - is it causal gene for ldl 
      - step 1: strong causal locus

        - lead rs553741 
        - also look at rarae variants: LoF gets lower CAD, LDL. GoF has higher hypercholesteriolemia

  - finding targets of convistion 
    - why: 90% of clinical drug dev fails (nature review 2019, p495-496)

    - target of convistion 
      - low risk validated target 
      - strong evidence of genetics or phamacological action in humans 
        - caveat: not all drug targets can be supported by human genetic evidence 
      - adequate safety margnins 
      - technical feasible 
        - does a feasible tool exist 
        - novel targets may raise conerns 

  - human genetics in drug discovery 
    - look at astra zenaca, nature reviews 2014, p419-431 

  - trials are more likely to stop for safety reasons if the target gene 
    - highly constrained in human populations 
    - not selectively expressed 
    - genes with highly interactive proteins (protein/protein interactions)
    - physiologcal characterization 
      - look at human knockout populaions
