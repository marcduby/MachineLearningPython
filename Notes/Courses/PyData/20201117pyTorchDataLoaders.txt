- mantra
  - all data needs to be preprocessed 

- training of NN
  - forward pass - provide inputs and outputs are generated
  - backward pass - loss calculated, and the weights are updated to minimize this loss (opposite direction if gradient -> gradient descent)
  - repeat n number of epochs or until certain loss 
  - data needs
    - shuffle the data when training
    - put the data into batches (all batches processed per epoch)
    - sampling wih r without replacements
    - could possibly use data augmentation when needed

- ie:
  for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
    for batch in iter(dataset, no_replacement, shuffle=True):
      X, y = batch
      optimizer.zero_grad()                 # zero out previous gradients
      y_train = model(X)                    # compute output
      loss = criterion(y_train, y)          # calculate loss
      loss.backward()                       # backward pass
      optimizer.step()                      # optimize weights

- when analyzing categorical classificatuion data, make sure the data is spread out evenly in the categories
  - also make sure it is equally distributed in the categories within the test/train segments

- dataloader
  - collate_fn -> function that is called when data loader has to get the next batch
