- classification
  - w1 x1 + w2 x2 + b = 0
    - if < 0, then refjected; if >= 0, accepted

- for n dimensions, the seperation line is an n-1 hyperplane
- step function of perceptron
  - 1 if > 0, 0 otherwise

- biological network
  - neuron from brain takes in input from dendrites and outputs to axon an electrical impulse after applying a gating function

- error functions
  - cannot be discrete, must be continuous
    - for correctly classified points, only add small error
    - for incorrectly classified points, add laregr error proportional to distance to boundary line
  - must be differentible
  - gradient descent

- non linear regions
