- time series have euqally spacwed data over time
- univariate -> one value at each time slow
  - multivariante has ultiple values at each step (multiple graphs)
  - ie: birth rate and death rate over time; study as multvariate since they can be related on each otjer
  - ie: co2 and temp over time

- uses
  - forecasting (stock prices)
  - detect anomalies

- patterns
  - trends (up or down)
  - seasonality (sales during holidays, temp drop at night)
  - trend + seasonality
  - noise
  - ternd + seasonality + noise

- split of data  
  - whenn split into train/validate/test, make sure each split has a full wrap of seasonality
  - when tuning, train on train dataset and evaluate st on the vaidation
    - then when have model and hyperparameters, train on whole train + validation and evaluate on test dataset
    - then before deoloyment, train one last time on whole train + validation + test data  
      - want test sine most recent data usually has best information

- roll forwarding partitioning
  - use rolling window for training
