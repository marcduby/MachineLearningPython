1200 - panel on ml in genomics (scripps, vanedrbilt)
- scripps - use of poligenic risk scores on how to treat patients with heart disease
  - pushback from the clinical community
  - foot dragging for health insurers, cost issue
- are there any fda approved algos for disease treatments 

- scripps digital twin effrts
  - simple nearest neighbor analysis using outcomes for old patients on new patients 
    - use similar symptoms/genomics, then look at successful treatments 

- vanderbilt training of ml 
  - use local hardware to test/develop, then use paid cloud to train once at the end 

- imputation/synthetic data 
  - still work in progress, but huge need for imputation
  - wouldn't need synthetic data if had annotated data for billions of people across the ancestries 

- getting into thwe field
  - it's one thing to be knowledgeable, it's another to be a tool builder
  - t52 program focused on genomic medicine
