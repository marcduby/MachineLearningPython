- rtatman presentation, non nn models
  - nn can cost $56k to train from scratch
  - other classes
    - regression tehniques, families of them (linear, mixed effect)
    - tree (random forests popular kaggle)
      - to avoid overfitting, people will delete leaves or level above after training
    - distance (nearest neighbor, gaussian mixture models, support vector machines)

- notes
  - read google's rules on ML
  - MRR used for ranking algorithm metric
  - for logistic regression, use log loss function
  - tf estimator api, can use tree and linear models easily
  - tf used to be able to serialize models from python and load them in go
