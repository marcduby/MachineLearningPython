got chat gpt string: A study conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford using exome sequencing to explore protein-altering variants and their consequences in 454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study has identified 564 genes with trait associations including 12 million coding variants, including around one million loss-of-function and around 1.8 million deleterious missense variants. The researchers performed collapsing analyses on 454,796 UK Biobank exomes to detect gene-level associations with diabetes. The study found that recessive carriers of nonsynonymous variants were 30% less likely to develop diabetes and had lower glycosylated hemoglobin suggesting protection against insulin resistance even in the setting of obesity. It was also observed that the protective effect of these variants was stronger in individuals who did not carry the Latino-enriched risk haplotype. Furthermore, the study identified a Finnish-enriched protein-truncating variant associated with decreased odds of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in FinnGen. No adverse phenotypes were associated with protein-truncating variants in the UKB, supporting this gene as a therapeutic target for diabetes. The study also discovered several risk-increasing associations with traits related to liver disease, eye disease, and cancer, among others, as well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. The researchers were able to illustrate the ability of exome sequencing to identify gene-trait associations, elucidate gene function and pinpoint effector genes that underlie genome-wide association studies signals at scale.

A major goal in human genetics is to use natural variation to understand the phenotypic consequences of altering each protein-coding gene in the genome. Here we used exome sequencing to explore protein-altering variants and their consequences in 454,787 participants in the UK Biobank study. We identified 12 million coding variants, including around 1 million loss-of-function and around 1.8 million deleterious missense variants. When these were tested for association with 3,994 health-related traits, we found 564 genes with trait associations at P ≤ 2.18 × 10. Rare variant associations were enriched in loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but most (91%) were independent of common variant signals. We discovered several risk-increasing associations with traits related to liver disease, eye disease and cancer, among others, as well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension (SLC9A3R2), diabetes (MAP3K15, FAM234A) and asthma (SLC27A3). Six genes were associated with brain imaging phenotypes, including two involved in neural development (GBE1, PLD1). Of the signals available and powered for replication in an independent cohort, 81% were confirmed; furthermore, association signals were generally consistent across individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry. We illustrate the ability of exome sequencing to identify gene-trait associations, elucidate gene function and pinpoint effector genes that underlie GWAS signals at scale.

However, the role of most MAP3K in kidney disease remains unexplored.

got chat gpt string: The CA2 region of the hippocampus in mice has been neglected for a long time but is now attracting attention due to its unique position between CA1 and CA3 and its role in social memory regulation. However, the small size of CA2 makes it difficult to accurately target and manipulate. To address this, a team has developed an AAV tool expressing Cre driven by the mini Map3k15 promoter, AAV/M1-Cre, which can help trace and manipulate CA2 pyramidal neurons. Although this tool also labeled some CA3-like neurons and interneurons, it provides a new and more flexible strategy for studying the CA2 region's function in the future. In another study, chromosomal conformation and H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modifications were found to be involved in regulating queen-worker differentiation in honeybees. The study also identified as a potential caste gene. Finally, a UK Biobank exome study found that recessive carriers of nonsynonymous variants in  were less likely to develop diabetes, and the protective effect was stronger in those who did not carry the Latino-enriched  risk haplotype. A Finnish-enriched  protein-truncating variant associated with decreased odds of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes was also identified in FinnGen. No adverse phenotypes were associated with protein-truncating  variants, suggesting that it could be a therapeutic target for diabetes.

Mice hippocampus contains three prominent subregions, CA1, CA3 and DG and is well regarded as an essential multiple task processor for learning, memory and cognition based on tremendous studies on these three subregions. The narrow region sandwiched between CA1 and CA3 called CA2 has been neglected for a long time. But it raises great attentions recently since this region manifests the indispensable role in social memory. Its unique physical position connecting CA1 and CA3 suggests the potential novel functions besides social memory regulation. But the CA2 is too small to be accurately targeted. A flexible AAV tool capable of accurately and efficiently targeting this region is highly demanded. To fill this gap, we generate an AAV expressing Cre driven by the mini Map3k15 promoter, AAV/M1-Cre, which can be easily utilized to help tracing and manipulating CA2 pyramidal neurons. However, M1-Cre labeled a small percentage of M1RGS14 neurons that do not colocalize with any RGS14/STEP/PEP4/Amigo2 pyramidal neurons. They are proved to be the mixture of normal CA2 pyramidal neurons, CA3-like neurons in CA2-CA3 mixed border, some CA2 interneurons and rarely few CA1-like neurons, which are probably the ones projecting to the revealed CA2 downstream targets, VMH, STHY and PMV in WT mice injecting this AAV/M1-Cre virus but not in Amigo2-Cre mice. Though it is still challenging to get a pure CA2 tracking and manipulation system, this tool provides a new, more flexible and extended strategy for in-depth CA2 functional study in the future.

Phenotypic dimorphism between queens and workers is an important biological characteristic of honeybees that has been the subject of intensive research. The enormous differences in morphology, lifespan, physiology, and behavior between queens and workers are caused by a complicated set of factors. Epigenetic modifications are considered to play an important role in this process. In this study, we analyzed the differences in chromosome interactions and H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modifications between the queens and workers using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technologies. We found that the queens contain more chromosome interactions and more unique H3K27ac modifications than workers; in contrast, workers have more H3K4me1 modifications than queens. Moreover, we identified  as a potential caste gene in queen-worker differentiation. Our results suggest that chromosomal conformation and H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modifications are involved in regulating queen-worker differentiation, which reveals that the queen-worker phenotypic dimorphism is regulated by multiple epigenetic modifications.

Giant congenital melanocytic nevus (GCMN) is the benign nevomelanocytic proliferation. Mutations in NRAS have been previously detected in GCMN, but mutations in BRAF are generally lacking in the Chinese population. Mutated genes in this disease can estimate the risk of malignant transformation in GCMN. Therefore, it is worth investigating the genetic information of GCMN. Here, we presented two cases of GCMN of the upper extremities. The clinical and histological data were analyzed. The whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to investigate the mutational profile of peripheral venous blood (PB), normal skin (NS), small melanocytic nevus (SMN), deep penetrating and non-penetrating GCMN (dPGCMN and nPGCMN). We showed a reduction in the circumference of involved upper extremities in both patients. The clinical and histopathological data indicated the reduction of adipose tissue associated with the invasion of GCMN. The WES data revealed that MUC16, MAP3K15 and ABCA1 were novel potential candidate genes for the disease as well as biomarkers for predicting malignant transformation. The MUC16, MAP3K15 and ABCA1 may serve as novel biomarkers for predicting malignant transformation and targets for the diagnoses and therapy for the GCMN.

Genetic causes that lead to spermatogenetic failure in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) have not been yet completely established. To identify low-frequency NOA-associated single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Men with various types of NOA (n = 39), including samples that had been previously tested with whole-exome sequencing (WES; n = 6) and did not result in diagnostic conclusions. Variants were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, utilizing frequencies from GnomAD and other databases to provide clinically relevant information (ClinVar), conservation scores (phyloP), and effect predictions (i.e., MutationTaster). Structural protein modeling was also performed. Using WGS, we revealed potential NOA-associated SNVs, such as: TKTL1, IGSF1, ZFPM2, VCX3A (novel disease causing variants), ESX1, TEX13A, TEX14, DNAH1, FANCM, QRICH2, FSIP2, USP9Y, PMFBP1, MEI1, PIWIL1, WDR66, ZFX, KCND1, KIAA1210, DHRSX, ZMYM3, FAM47C, FANCB, FAM50B (genes previously known to be associated with infertility) and ALG13, BEND2, BRWD3, DDX53, TAF4, FAM47B, FAM9B, FAM9C, MAGEB6, MAP3K15, RBMXL3, SSX3 and FMR1NB genes, which may be involved in spermatogenesis. In this study, we identified novel potential candidate NOA-associated genes in 29 individuals out of 39 azoospermic males. Note that in 5 out of 6 patients subjected previously to WES analysis, which did not disclose potentially causative variants, the WGS analysis was successful with NOA-associated gene findings.

Standard of care for lower-grade glioma (LGG) is maximal safe resection and risk-adaptive adjuvant therapy. While patients who benefit the most from adjuvant chemotherapy have been elucidated in prospective randomized studies, comparable insights for adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) are lacking. We sought to identify and validate patterns of gene expression that are associated with differential outcomes among LGG patients treated by RT from two large genomics databases. Patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with LGG (WHO grade II-III glioma) treated by surgery and adjuvant RT were randomized 1:1 to a discovery cohort or an internal validation cohort. Using the discovery cohort only, associations between tumor RNA-seq expression and progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) were evaluated with adjustment for clinicopathologic covariates. A Genomic Risk Score (GRS) was then constructed from the expression levels of top genes also screened for involvement in glioma carcinogenesis. The prognostic value of GRS was further assessed in the internal validation cohort of TCGA and a second distinct database, compiled by the Chinese Glioma Genome Association (CGGA). From TCGA, 289 patients with LGG received adjuvant RT alone (38 grade II, 30 grade III) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) (51 grade II, 170 grade III) between 2009 and 2015. From CGGA, 178 patients with LGG received adjuvant RT alone (40 grade II, 13 grade III) or CRT (41 grade II, 84 grade III) between 2004 and 2016. The genes comprising GRS are involved in MAP kinase activity, T cell chemotaxis, and cell cycle transition: MAP3K15, MAPK10, CCL3, CCL4, and ADAMTS1. High GRS, defined as having a GRS in the top third, was significantly associated with poorer outcomes independent of age, sex, glioma histology, WHO grade, IDH mutation, 1p/19q co-deletion, and chemotherapy status in the discovery cohort (PFS HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.10-2.36, P = 0.014; OS HR 2.74, 95% CI 1.68-4.47, P < 0.001). These findings were replicated in the internal validation cohort (PFS HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05-2.37, P = 0.027; OS HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.13-3.00, P = 0.015) and the CGGA external validation cohort (OS HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.27-2.34, P < 0.001). Association between GRS and outcomes was observed only among patients who underwent RT, in both TCGA and CGGA. This study successfully identified an expression signature of five genes that stratified outcomes among LGG patients who received adjuvant RT, with two rounds of validation leveraging independent genomics databases. Expression levels of the highlighted genes were associated with PFS and OS only among patients whose treatment included RT, but not among those with omission of RT, suggesting that expression of these genes may be predictive of radiation treatment response. While additional prospective studies are warranted, interrogation of these genes may be considered in the multidisciplinary management of LGG.

The purpose of this research was to explore the diagnostic/prognostic significance and prospective molecular mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases () in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Diagnostic/prognostic significance of  was screened in the GSE1450 data set and validated in the Guangxi cohort. Various bioinformatics tools were used to explore the biological functions of prognosis-related genes. Subsequently, molecular biology assays were used to verify the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of specific gene.  was observed to be differentially expressed in HCC and adjacent tissues with satisfactory diagnostic value. It was discovered in survival analysis that  and  were associated with overall survival (OS) of patients with HBV-related HCC in the GSE1450 data set and the Guangxi cohort. Nomograms were established based on prognosis-related genes and clinical factors for individualized risk assessment. The assays on HCC cells demonstrated that MAP3K13 regulated the death and proliferation of HCC cells by activating the JNK pathway and inducing the expression of apoptosis-related factors. In conclusion, our results suggested that  might serve as a diagnostic biomarker in HBV-related HCC and  and  might serve as useful prognostic biomarkers. Besides, cytological assays prompted that MAP3K13 might impact the prognosis of HCC by regulating the JNK pathway and inducing apoptosis.

Rare variant associations were enriched in loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but most (91%) were independent of common variant signals. We discovered several risk-increasing associations with traits related to liver disease, eye disease and cancer, among others, as well as risk-lowering associations for hypertension (SLC9A3R2), diabetes (MAP3K15, FAM234A) and asthma (SLC27A3). Six genes were associated with brain imaging phenotypes, including two involved in neural development (GBE1, PLD1). Of the signals available and powered for replication in an independent cohort, 81% were confirmed; furthermore, association signals were generally consistent across individuals of European, Asian and African ancestry. We illustrate the ability of exome sequencing to identify gene-trait associations, elucidate gene function and pinpoint effector genes that underlie GWAS signals at scale.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is a type of primary malignant tumor, and increasing evidence shows the clinical benefits of immunotherapy in treating OS. However, the lack of comprehensive studies on the complex OS immune microenvironment hinders the application of immunotherapy. Thus, this study aimed to systematically explore the immune characteristics of OS and identify novel biomarkers for OS treatment. We systematically studied the immune score and proportions of infiltrating immune cells in OS in the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases using the ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT algorithms. Differential expression and functional analyses were used to identify dysregulated genes and explore their functions. Survival and Cox regression analyses were applied to establish an immune-related prognostic signature. Additionally, qPCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to validate the results. A total of 103 differentially expressed immune genes (DEIGs) were found in the TARGET-OS and GSE39058 databases, and these DEIGs were mainly enriched in leukocyte proliferation, leukocyte differentiation, osteoclast differentiation, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and the adaptive immune system. A predictive signature was constructed based on the survival analysis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.65. Moreover, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 15 (MAP3K15) can predict the prognosis of patients with OS and is closely related to CD4 T cells and macrophages. The OS patients with high MAP3K15 expression had a significantly poorer prognosis. Our study found that MAP3K15, whose expression level is closely related to immune activity in tumors, is a critical immune-related biomarker, and our findings may provide a basis for OS immunotherapy.

Our pilot clinical study of EphA2 inhibitor (dasatinib) plus paclitaxel and carboplatin showed interesting clinical activity in endometrial cancer with manageable toxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms of dasatinib resistance in uterine cancer are unknown. Here, we investigated potential mechanisms underlying resistance to EphA2 inhibitors in uterine cancer and examined the anti-tumor activity of EphA2 inhibitors alone and in combination with a MEK inhibitor. We evaluated the antitumor activity of EphA2 inhibitors plus a MEK inhibitor using in vitro and in vivo orthotopic models of uterine cancer. EphA2 inhibitor induced MAPK in dasatinib-resistant uterine cancer cells (HEC-1A and Ishikawa) and BRAF/CRAF heterodimerization in HEC-1A cells. EphA2 inhibitor and trametinib significantly increased apoptosis in cancer cells resistant to EphA2 inhibitors compared with controls (p < 0.01). An in vivo study with the orthotopic HEC-1A model showed significantly greater antitumor response to combination treatment compared with dasatinib alone (p < 0.01). Combination treatment increased EphrinA1 and BIM along with decreased pMAPK, Jagged 1, and c-MYC expression in dasatinib-resistant cells. In addition, Spearman analysis using the TCGA data revealed that upregulation of EphA2 was significantly correlated with JAG1, MYC, NOTCH1, NOTCH3 and HES1 expression (p < 0.001, r = 0.25-0.43). Specifically, MAP3K15 and the NOTCH family genes were significantly related to poor clinical outcome in patients with uterine cancer. These findings indicate that the MAPK pathway is activated in dasatinib-resistant uterine cancer cells and that EphrinA1-mediated MEK inhibition overcomes dasatinib resistance. Dual targeting of both EphA2 and MEK, combined with chemotherapy, should be considered for future clinical development.

Cells are under threat of osmotic perturbation; cell volume maintenance is critical in cerebral edema, inflammation and aging, in which prominent changes in intracellular or extracellular osmolality emerge. After osmotic stress-enforced cell swelling or shrinkage, the cells regulate intracellular osmolality to recover their volume. However, the mechanisms recognizing osmotic stress remain obscured. We previously clarified that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 3 (ASK3) bidirectionally responds to osmotic stress and regulates cell volume recovery. Here, we show that macromolecular crowding induces liquid-demixing condensates of ASK3 under hyperosmotic stress, which transduce osmosensing signal into ASK3 inactivation. A genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen identifies an ASK3 inactivation regulator, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), related to poly(ADP-ribose) signaling. Furthermore, we clarify that poly(ADP-ribose) keeps ASK3 condensates in the liquid phase and enables ASK3 to become inactivated under hyperosmotic stress. Our findings demonstrate that cells rationally incorporate physicochemical phase separation into their osmosensing systems.

Aging is a multifactorial process that leads to molecular and cellular changes, contributing to the susceptibility of most lung diseases. However, the molecular and genetic mechanism of lung aging remains poorly understood. Here, we performed RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of the lung tissues of 68 subjects and analyzed their gene expression profile to evaluate candidate genes related to lung aging. The subjects were classified into two groups (Younger group and Older group) based on their age. Lung tissues were obtained from surgically resected specimens, processed, and analyzed with RNA-seq. The median age of the subjects was 45 years in the Younger group and 74 years in the Older group. Around 71% and 53% of the subjects were female in the Younger and Older groups, respectively. After gene quality control and filtering, differentially expressed gene analysis showed that  and  were upregulated in the Younger group, whereas  and  were upregulated in the Older group. Multivariate analysis with adjustment for covariates showed that  was a risk factor for lung aging. Our study identified differences in the gene expression of the lungs of older subjects compared with younger subjects. These findings may have implications in lung aging.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinases (ASK1, ASK2, and ASK3) are activators of the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. ASK1-3 form oligomeric complexes known as ASK signalosomes that initiate signaling cascades in response to diverse stress stimuli. Here, we demonstrated that oligomerization of ASK proteins is driven by previously uncharacterized sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domains that reside at the carboxy-terminus of each ASK protein. SAM domains from ASK1-3 exhibited distinct behaviors, with the SAM domain of ASK1 forming unstable oligomers, that of ASK2 remaining predominantly monomeric, and that of ASK3 forming a stable oligomer even at a low concentration. In contrast to their behavior in isolation, the ASK1 and ASK2 SAM domains preferentially formed a stable heterocomplex. The crystal structure of the ASK3 SAM domain, small-angle x-ray scattering, and mutagenesis suggested that ASK3 oligomers and ASK1-ASK2 complexes formed discrete, quasi-helical rings through interactions between the mid-loop of one molecule and the end helix of another molecule. Preferential ASK1-ASK2 binding was consistent with mass spectrometry showing that full-length ASK1 formed hetero-oligomeric complexes incorporating large amounts of ASK2. Accordingly, disrupting the association between SAM domains impaired ASK activity in the context of electrophilic stress induced by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). These findings provide a structural template for how ASK proteins assemble foci that drive inflammatory signaling and reinforce the notion that strategies to target ASK proteins should consider the concerted actions of multiple ASK family members.

The chromobox homolog 2 (CBX2) was found to be important for human testis development, but its role in the human ovary remains elusive. We conducted a genome-wide analysis based on DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) and RNA sequencing strategies to investigate CBX2 in the human granulosa cells. Functional analysis revealed that CBX2 was upstream of genes contributing to ovarian function like folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis (i.e. ESR1, NRG1, AKR1C1, PTGER2, BMP15, BMP2, FSHR and NTRK1/2). We identified CBX2 regulated genes associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) such as TGFβ, MAP3K15 and DKK1, as well as genes implicated in premature ovarian failure (POF) (i.e. POF1B, BMP15 and HOXA13) and the pituitary deficiency (i.e. LHX4 and KISS1). Our study provided an excellent opportunity to identify genes surrounding CBX2 in the ovary and might contribute to the understanding of ovarian physiopathology causing infertility in women.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) are functionally connected kinases that regulate key cellular process involved in kidney disease such as all survival, death, differentiation and proliferation. The typical MAP kinase module is composed by a cascade of three kinases: a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K) which phosphorylates a MAP kinase (MAPK). While the role of MAPKs such as ERK, p38 and JNK has been well characterized in experimental kidney injury, much less is known about the apical kinases in the cascade, the MAP3Ks. There are 24 characterized MAP3K (MAP3K1 to MAP3K21 plus RAF1, BRAF and ARAF). We now review current knowledge on the involvement of MAP3K in non-malignant kidney disease and the therapeutic tools available. There is in vivo interventional evidence clearly supporting a role for MAP3K5 (ASK1) and MAP3K14 (NIK) in the pathogenesis of experimental kidney disease. Indeed, the ASK1 inhibitor Selonsertib has undergone clinical trials for diabetic kidney disease. Additionally, although MAP3K7 (MEKK7, TAK1) is required for kidney development, acutely targeting MAP3K7 protected from acute and chronic kidney injury; and targeting MAP3K8 (TPL2/Cot) protected from acute kidney injury. By contrast MAP3K15 (ASK3) may protect from hypertension and BRAF inhibitors in clinical use may induced acute kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome. Given their role as upstream regulators of intracellular signaling, MAP3K are potential therapeutic targets in kidney injury, as demonstrated for some of them. However, the role of most MAP3K in kidney disease remains unexplored.

Daily rhythms of behaviors and physiologies are generated by the circadian clock, which is composed of clock genes and the encoded proteins forming transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs). The circadian clock is a self-sustained oscillator and flexibly responds to various time cues to synchronize with environmental 24-h cycles. However, the key molecule that transmits cellular stress to the circadian clockwork is unknown. Here we identified apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK), a member of the MAPKKK family, as an essential mediator determining the circadian period and phase of cultured cells in response to osmotic changes of the medium. The physiological impact of ASK signaling was demonstrated by a response of the clock to changes in intracellular redox states. Intriguingly, the TTFLs drive rhythmic expression of  genes, indicating ASK-mediated association of the TTFLs with intracellular redox. In behavioral analysis, , , and  triple-KO mice exhibited compromised light responses of the circadian period and phase in their activity rhythms. LC-MS/MS-based proteomic analysis identified a series of ASK-dependent and osmotic stress-responsive phosphorylations of proteins, among which CLOCK, a key component of the molecular clockwork, was phosphorylated at Thr843 or Ser845 in the carboxyl-terminal region. These findings reveal the ASK-dependent stress response as an underlying mechanism of circadian clock flexibility.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor Sunitinib is used to treat cancer and is linked to severe adverse cardiovascular events. Mitogen activated kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) is involved in the development of cardiac injury and is a component of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction pathway. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is the upstream activator of MKK7 and is specifically inhibited by 2,7-dihydro-2,7-dioxo-3H-naphtho[1,2,3-de]quinoline-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (NQDI-1). This study investigates the role of ASK1, MKK7 and JNK during Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. Infarct size were measured in isolated male Sprague-Dawley rat Langendorff perfused hearts treated for 125 min with Sunitinib in the presence and absence of NQDI-1. Left ventricular cardiac tissue samples were analysed by qRT-PCR for MKK7 mRNA expression and cardiotoxicity associated microRNAs (miR-1, miR-27a, miR-133a and miR-133b) or Western blot analysis to measure ASK1/MKK7/JNK phosphorylation. Administration of Sunitinib (1 μM) during Langendorff perfusion resulted in increased infarct size, increased miR-133a expression, and decreased phosphorylation of the ASK1/MKK7/JNK pathway compared to control. Co-administration of NQDI-1 (2.5 μM) attenuated the increased Sunitinib-induced infarct size, reversed miR-133a expression and restored phosphorylated levels of ASK1/MKK7/JNK. These findings suggest that the ASK1/MKK7/JNK intracellular signalling pathway is important in Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity. The anti-cancer properties of Sunitinib were also assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. Sunitinib significantly decreased the cell viability of human acute myeloid leukemia 60 cell line (HL60). The combination of Sunitinib (1 nM-10 μM) with NQDI-1 (2.5 μM) enhanced the cancer-fighting properties of Sunitinib. Investigations into the ASK1/MKK7/JNK transduction pathway could lead to development of cardioprotective adjunct therapy, which could prevent Sunitinib-induced cardiac injury.

In humans, the adrenal glands and gonads undergo distinct biological events between 6-10 weeks post conception (wpc), such as testis determination, the onset of steroidogenesis and primordial germ cell development. However, relatively little is currently known about the genetic mechanisms underlying these processes. We therefore aimed to generate a detailed genomic atlas of adrenal and gonad development across these critical stages of human embryonic and fetal development. RNA was extracted from 53 tissue samples between 6-10 wpc (adrenal, testis, ovary and control). Affymetrix array analysis was performed and differential gene expression was analysed using Bioconductor. A mathematical model was constructed to investigate time-series changes across the dataset. Pathway analysis was performed using ClueGo and cellular localisation of novel factors confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Using this approach, we have identified novel components of adrenal development (e.g. , ) and confirmed the role of  as the main human testis-determining gene. By mathematical modelling time-series data we have found new genes up-regulated with  in the testis (e.g. ), which may represent components of the testis development pathway. We have shown that testicular steroidogenesis has a distinct onset at around 8 wpc and identified potential novel components in adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis (e.g. , , , , ), as well as testis biomarkers (e.g. ). We have also shown that the developing human ovary expresses distinct subsets of genes (e.g. , ), but enrichment for established biological pathways is limited. This genomic atlas is revealing important novel aspects of human development and new candidate genes for adrenal and reproductive disorders.

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a key sensor kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that transduces cellular responses to oxidants and electrophiles. ASK1 is regulated by a large, dynamic multiprotein signalosome complex, potentially including over 90 reported ASK1-interacting proteins. We employed both shotgun and targeted mass spectrometry assays to catalogue the ASK1 protein-protein interactions in HEK-293 cells treated with the prototypical lipid electrophile 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). Using both epitope-tagged overexpression and endogenous expression cell systems, we verified most of the previously reported ASK1 protein-protein interactions and identified 14 proteins that exhibited dynamic shifts in association with ASK1 in response to HNE stress. We used precise stable isotope dilution assays to quantify protein stoichiometry in the ASK signalosome complex and identified ASK2 at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with ASK1 and 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAQ, YWHAB, YWHAH, and YWHAE) collectively at a 0.5:1 ratio with ASK1 as the main components. Several other proteins, including ASK3, PARK7, PRDX1, and USP9X were detected with stoichiometries of 0.1:1 or less. These data support an ASK signalosome comprising a multimeric core complex of ASK1, ASK2, and 14-3-3 proteins, which dynamically engages other binding partners needed to mediate diverse stress-response signaling events. This study further demonstrates the value of combining global and targeted MS approaches to interrogate multiprotein complex composition and dynamics.

The With No lysine [K] (WNK)-Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK)/oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) pathway has been reported to be a crucial signaling pathway for triggering pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), an autosomal dominant hereditary disease that is characterized by hypertension. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway is regulated remain unclear. In this report, we identified WNK4 as an interacting partner of a recently identified MAP3K, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 3 (ASK3). We found that WNK4 is phosphorylated in an ASK3 kinase activity-dependent manner. By exploring the ASK3-dependent phosphorylation sites, we identified Ser575 as a novel phosphorylation site in WNK4 by LC-MS/MS analysis. ASK3-dependent WNK4 Ser575 phosphorylation was mediated by the p38MAPK-MAPK-activated protein kinase (MK) pathway. Osmotic stress, as well as hypotonic low-chloride stimulation, increased WNK4 Ser575 phosphorylation via the p38MAPK-MK pathway. ASK3 was required for the p38MAPK activation induced by hypotonic stimulation but was not required for that induced by hypertonic stimulation or hypotonic low-chloride stimulation. Our results suggest that the p38MAPK-MK pathway might regulate WNK4 in an osmotic stress-dependent manner but its upstream regulators might be divergent depending on the types of osmotic stimuli.
