1. AGPAT2 is a gene associated with various forms of lipodystrophy resulting in severe metabolic complications such as hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis. 
2. BSCL2 plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and the formation of lipid droplets and mutations in the gene lead to various disorders including Berardinelli-Seip congenital 
lipodystrophy type 2, peripheral neuropathies, and hereditary spastic paraplegia. 
3. CAV1 is a transmembrane protein associated with various diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, intervertebral disc degeneration, and obesity. 
4. LMNA mutations are associated with various malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders, and research has identified potential therapeutic targets for these disorders. 
5. PLIN1 is involved in regulating lipid metabolism and lipolysis and is associated with various pathological conditions including obesity, metabolic disorders, and heart failure,

1. The article discusses the relationship between genes in the CEL, HNF1B, HNF4, KLF11, NEUROD1 gene sets and medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and endometriosis. 2. Variants in HNF1B are associated with multiple health conditions, including diabetes, renal disease, and polycystic kidney disease. 3. HNF4 is essential for early embryonic development and is differentially expressed in different tissues. 4. KLF11 is a tumor suppressor that inhibits cellular growth and regulates INS transcription by binding to the promoter via specific GC-rich sites and recruiting Sin3-histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling complexes. 5. NEUROD1 is essential for neuronal differentiation, maturation, and survival in pancreatic endocrine cells, neuroblastoma, and during astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming.

1. AGPAT2: Mutations in AGPAT2 lead to a reduction in adipose tissue, resulting in a lipoatrophic phenotype, and play a significant role in lipid droplet synthesis and affect various tissues, leading to steatosis and dysfunction. 2. BSCL2: Mutations in BSCL2 lead to various disorders, including Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2), peripheral neuropathies, hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). 3. CAV1: CAV1 is a transmembrane protein involved in numerous medical conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, intervertebral disc degeneration, and obesity. 4. LMNA: Mutations in LMNA cause laminopathies, which affect the heart, skeletal muscles, and skin/bone disorders. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is one of the most notable conditions caused by LMNA mutations, where patients experience severe aging symptoms. 5. PLIN1: PLIN1 is involved in regulating lipid metabolism and lipolysis and has been linked to various pathological conditions, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and heart failure.

1. CEL: Patients with CEL had higher levels of corneal horizontal coma and lower levels of corneal vertical coma primary spherical aberrations compared to healthy controls. 2. HNF1B: Mutations in HNF1B are associated with multiple health conditions, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young, polycystic kidney disease, exocrine pancreatic cancer, and MRKH syndrome. 3. HNF4: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that plays a complex and diverse role in regulating gene expressions in various organs. The genes encoding HNF4 alpha and HNF4 gamma are located on human chromosomes 20 and 8, respectively. 4. KLF11: KLF11 is a tumour suppressor that inhibits cellular growth and is critical in integrating progesterone receptor signaling and proliferation in uterine leiomyoma cells. Variants of KLF11 have been found to have a negative impact on insulin sensitivity and may play a role in type 2 diabetes. 5. NEUROD1: NEUROD1 is crucial for neuronal differentiation, maturation, and survival in pancreatic endocrine cells, neuroblastoma, and during astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming. Dysregulation of NEUROD1 is involved in various diseases such as SCLC, CRC, and severe neonatal diabetes. ``` Can you please provide information on the Gene Set and the text delimited by triple backquotes?
