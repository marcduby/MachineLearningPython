Cancer is characterized by abnormal growth of cells. Targeting ubiquitin proteins in the discovery of new anticancer therapeutics is an attractive strategy. The present study uses the structure-based drug discovery methods to identify new lead structures, which are selective to the putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2N-like (UBE2NL). The 3D structure of the UBE2NL was evaluated using homology modeling techniques. The model was validated using standard in silico methods. The hydrophobic pocket of UBE2NL that aids in binding with its natural receptor ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant (UBE2V) was identified through protein-protein docking study. The binding site region of the UBE2NL was identified using active site prediction tools. The binding site of UBE2NL which is responsible for cancer cell progression is considered for docking study. Virtual screening study with the small molecular structural database was carried out against the active site of UBE2NL. The ligand molecules that have shown affinity towards UBE2NL were considered for ADME prediction studies. The ligand molecules that obey the Lipinski's rule of five and Jorgensen's rule of three pharmacokinetic properties like human oral absorption etc. are prioritized. The resultant ligand molecules can be considered for the development of potent UBE2NL enzyme inhibitors for cancer therapy.Migraine without aura (MWO) is the most common among migraine group, and is mainly associated with genetic, physical and chemical factors, and hormonal changes. We aimed to identify novel non-synonymous mutations predisposing to the susceptibility to MWO in a Chinese sample using exome sequencing. Four patients with MWO from a family and four non-migraine subjects unrelated with these patients were genotyped using whole-exome sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis was used to screen possible susceptibility gene mutations, which were then verified by PCR. In four patients with MWO, six novel rare non-synonymous mutations were observed, including EDA2R (G170A), UBE2NL (T266G), GBP2 (A907G), EMR1 (C264G), CLCNKB (A1225G), and ARHGAP28 (C413G). It is worth stressing that GBP2 (A907G) was absent in any control subject. Multiple genes predispose to the susceptibility to MWO. ARHGAP28-, EMR1-, and GBP2-encoded proteins may affect angiokinesis, which supports vasogenic theory for the etiological hypothesis of this disease. CLCNKB-encoded protein may affect cell membrane potential, which is consistent with the cortical spreading depression theory. UBE2NL-encoded protein may regulate cellular responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is in accordance with trigeminovascular reflex theory. EDA2R and UBE2NL are located on the X chromosome, which supports that this disease may have gender differences in genetic predisposition. Replication in larger sample size would significantly strengthen these findings.Sporadic Alzheimer disease (SAD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. With the development of new generation DNA sequencing technologies, additional genetic risk factors have been described. Here we used various methods to process DNA sequencing data in order to gain further insight into this important disease. We have sequenced the exomes of brain samples from SAD patients and non-demented controls. Using either method, we found a higher number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), from SAD patients, in genes present at the X chromosome. Using the most stringent method, we validated these variants by Sanger sequencing. Two of these gene variants, were found in loci related to the ubiquitin pathway (UBE2NL and ATXN3L), previously do not described as genetic risk factors for SAD.Genetic association studies for gastroschisis have highlighted several candidate variants. However, genetic basis in gastroschisis from noninvestigated heritable factors could provide new insights into the human biology for this birth defect. We aim to identify novel gastroschisis susceptibility variants by employing whole exome sequencing (WES) in a Mexican family with recurrence of gastroschisis.We employed WES in two affected half-sisters with gastroschisis, mother, and father of the proband. Additionally, functional bioinformatics analysis was based on SVS-PhoRank and Ensembl-Variant Effect Predictor. The latter assessed the potentially deleterious effects (high, moderate, low, or modifier impact) from exome variants based on SIFT, PolyPhen, dbNSFP, Condel, LoFtool, MaxEntScan, and BLOSUM62 algorithms. The analysis was based on the Human Genome annotation, GRCh37/hg19. Candidate genes were prioritized and manually curated based on significant phenotypic relevance (SVS-PhoRank) and functional properties (Ensembl-Variant Effect Predictor). Functional enrichment analysis was performed using ToppGene Suite, including a manual curation of significant Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes from functional similarity analysis of candidate genes.No single gene-disrupting variant was identified. Instead, 428 heterozygous variations were identified for which SPATA17, PDE4DIP, CFAP65, ALPP, ZNF717, OR4C3, MAP2K3, TLR8, and UBE2NL were predicted as high impact in both cases, mother, and father of the proband. PLOD1, COL6A3, FGFRL1, HHIP, SGCD, RAPGEF1, PKD1, ZFHX3, BCAS3, EVPL, CEACAM5, and KLK14 were segregated among both cases and mother. Multiple interacting background modifiers may regulate gastroschisis susceptibility. These candidate genes highlight a role for development of blood vessel, circulatory system, muscle structure, epithelium, and epidermis, regulation of cell junction assembly, biological/cell adhesion, detection/response to endogenous stimulus, regulation of cytokine biosynthetic process, response to growth factor, postreplication repair/protein K63-linked ubiquitination, protein-containing complex assembly, and regulation of transcription DNA-templated.Considering the likely gene-disrupting prediction results and similar biological pattern of mechanisms, we propose a joint "multifactorial model" in gastroschisis pathogenesis.

Gene UBE2NL (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N-like) is involved in various biological processes and has been implicated in different diseases. Here is a summary of the biology of gene UBE2NL based on the provided information:

Cancer: UBE2NL is a putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a role in cancer cell progression. It has a binding site responsible for cancer cell progression and interacts with its natural receptor, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant (UBE2V). In the study mentioned, structure-based drug discovery methods were used to identify lead structures that selectively target UBE2NL. These lead structures have the potential to be developed into potent UBE2NL enzyme inhibitors for cancer therapy.

Migraine without aura (MWO): UBE2NL is one of the genes identified in the study as having a novel non-synonymous mutation associated with the susceptibility to MWO. The UBE2NL-encoded protein may regulate cellular responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine, which is in line with the trigeminovascular reflex theory of migraine pathogenesis. Additionally, UBE2NL is located on the X chromosome, suggesting that gender differences in genetic predisposition may exist for this disease.

Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD): In individuals with SAD, an increased number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found in genes present on the X chromosome, including UBE2NL. This suggests that UBE2NL, along with ATXN3L, which is also related to the ubiquitin pathway, may serve as genetic risk factors for SAD. Further investigations are needed to understand the specific roles of these genes in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Gastroschisis: UBE2NL is among the candidate genes identified in a Mexican family with a recurrence of gastroschisis, a birth defect. Although no gene-disrupting variant was found, UBE2NL exhibited a high impact and was predicted to play a role in gastroschisis susceptibility. Other candidate genes identified in this study are involved in various biological processes related to development, cell structure, adhesion, and regulation of transcription.

In summary, UBE2NL is a gene with diverse implications in different diseases. It is involved in cancer cell progression, susceptibility to MWO, potential genetic risk for SAD, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of gastroschisis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific mechanisms by which UBE2NL influences these diseases.

for the following, summarize through what pathway gene PPARG impacts diabetes:
The use of triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) as a flame retardant or plasticizer has increased during the last decade, resulting in widespread human exposure without commensurate toxicity assessment. The main objectives of this study were to assess the in vitro effect of TPhP and its metabolite diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) on the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, as well as glucose uptake and lipolysis in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. TPhP increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and subsequent adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, coinciding with increased transcription in the CEBP and PPARG pathway. Treatment of mature adipocytes with TPhP increased the basal- and insulin stimulated- uptake of the glucose analog 2-[N (-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG). This effect was ablated by inhibition of PI3K, a member of the insulin signaling pathway. DPhP had no significant effect on cell proliferation and, compared to TPhP, a weaker effect on adipogenic differentiation and on 2-NBDG uptake. Both TPhP and DPhT significantly enhanced the isoproterenol-induced lipolysis, most likely by increasing the expression of lipolytic genes during and after differentiation. This study suggests that TPhP increases adipogenic differentiation, glucose uptake, and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells through endocrine and noradrenergic mechanisms. The transcription repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) represses genes involved in heme metabolism and oxidative stress response. BACH1 also suppresses the p53-dependent cellar senescence in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). To investigate the role of BACH1 in MEF other than its known functions, we carried out a genomewide mapping of binding site for BACH1 and its heterodimer partner MAFK in immortalized MEFs (iMEFs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing technology (ChIP-sequence). The comparative analysis of the ChIP-sequence data and DNA microarray data from Bach1-deficient and wild-type (WT) iMEF showed 35 novel candidate target genes of BACH1. Among these genes, five genes (Pparg, Nfia, Ptplad2, Adcy1 and Ror1) were related with lipid metabolism. Bach1-deficient iMEFs showed increased expression of mRNA and protein of PPAR&#x3b3;, which is the key factor of adipogenesis. These cells also showed a concomitant increase in ligand-dependent activation of PPAR&#x3b3; target genes compared with wild-type iMEFs. Moreover, Bach1-deficient iMEFs efficiently differentiated to adipocyte compared with wild-type cells in the presence of PPAR&#x3b3; ligands. Our results suggest that BACH1 regulates expression of adipocyte-related genes including Pparg and potentiates adipocyte differentiation capacity.

Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is the most common form of clonal mosaicism, caused by dysregulation in cell-cycle and DNA damage response pathways. Previous genetic studies have focussed on identifying common variants associated with LOY, which we now extend to rarer, protein-coding variation using exome sequences from 82,277 male UK Biobank participants. We find that loss of function of two genes-CHEK2 and GIGYF1-reach exome-wide significance. Rare alleles in GIGYF1 have not previously been implicated in any complex trait, but here loss-of-function carriers exhibit six-fold higher susceptibility to LOY (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.99 [3.04-11.81], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.3 &#xd7; 10These same alleles are also associated with adverse metabolic health, including higher susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes (OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.10 [3.51-10.61], p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.8&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10 higher fat mass (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.3&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10 2.32&#x2009;nmol/L lower serum IGF1 levels (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.5&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;10 and 4.5&#x2009;kg lower handgrip strength (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;4.7&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;1 consistent with proposed GIGYF1 enhancement of insulin and IGF-1 receptor signalling. These associations are mirrored by a common variant nearby associated with the expression of GIGYF1. Our observations highlight a potential direct connection between clonal mosaicism and metabolic health.

<i>ERK</i> in human neuroblastoma SHSY-5Y cells. Meanwhile, we detected cell apoptosis, proliferation, and migration. Our results showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased along with the increasing concentrations of glucose (0-200&#x2009;mM). The expression of
<i>GIGYF1</i> had a significant increase in the presence of 25&#x2009;mM concentration of glucose in SHSY-5Y cells. In addition, high glucose augmented the expression of
