| Obesity and overweight are worldwide public health problems with an evident genetic predisposition that is still poorly understood. In addition, great variability has been described across populations. In this work, we analyzed the association of variants in four genes: PPARG (rs1801282), PPARGC1A (rs8192678), FTO (rs9939609) and MC4R (rs17782313) with overweight and obesity in a large sample of the Brazilian population. The case-control study involved 4084 individuals (1844 with overweight or obesity; and 2240 with normal BMI). Genotyping was performed by quantitative PCR. MC4R rs17782313-C was associated with obesity (OR = 1.27, p = 0.038) and when stratifying by sex associated only in women (OR = 1.36, p = 0.030). FTO rs9939609-A allele was associated with overweight however for women it represented a risk factor (OR = 1.24, p = 0.034) and for men, a protective factor (OR = 0.68, p = 0.033).

| The nuclear receptors known as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG) are lipid-activated transcription factors that have emerged as key regulators of inflammation. PPARG ligands have been shown to have an anti-proliferative effect on a variety of cancers. These ligands can induce apoptosis via TP53 (Tumor protein p53) or ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) (EPHB2) pathways. However, the exact mechanism is not known. PPAR, a type II nuclear hormone receptor deserves attention as a selective target for radiotherapy. Our study examines the potential of selective agonism of PPARG for radiation therapy in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We found that the overexpression of PPARG protein as well as its induction using the agonist, rosiglitazone was able to stimulate radiation-induced cell death in otherwise radio resistant NSCLC A549 cell line. This cell death was apoptotic and was found to be BAX (BCL2 associated X) mediated. The treatment also inhibited radiation-induced AKT (Protein Kinase B) phosphorylation. Interestingly, the ionising radiation (IR) induced apoptosis was found to be inversely related to TP53 levels. A relatively significant increase in the levels of radiation induced apoptosis was observed in H1299 cells (TP53 null) under PPARG overexpression condition further supporting the inverse relationship between apoptosis and TP53 levels. The combination of PPARG agonist and radiation was able to induce apoptosis at a radiation dose at which A549 and H1299 are radioresistant, thus confirming the potential of the combinatorial strategy. Taken together, PPARG agonism was found to invigorate the radiosensitising effect and hence its use in combination with radiotherapy is expected to enhance sensitivity in otherwise resistant cancer types. |

The COVID-19 pandemic has currently developed into a worldwide threat to humankind. Importantly, patients with severe COVID-19 are believed to have a higher mortality risk than those with mild conditions. However, despite the urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies, the biological features and pathogenic mechanisms of severe COVID-19 are poorly understood.  Here, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four patients with severe COVID-19, four patients with mild COVID-19, and four healthy controls were examined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We conducted gene expression analysis and Venn diagrams to detect specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patients with severe disease compared with those with mild conditions. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significant biological processes, and protein-protein interaction networks were constructed to extract hub genes. These hub genes were then subjected to regulatory signatures and protein-chemical interaction analysis for certain regulatory checkpoints and identification of potent chemical agents. Finally, to demonstrate the cell type-specific expression of these genes, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq analyses using an online platform.  A total of 144 DEGs were specifically expressed in severe COVID-19, and GO enrichment analysis revealed a significant association of these specific DEGs with autophagy. Hub genes such as , , , and  were then found to be most significantly involved in the biological processes of autophagy at the transcriptome level. In addition, six transcription factors, including SRF, YY1, CREB1, PPARG, NFIC, and GATA2, as well as miRNAs, namely, hsa-mir-1-3p, and potent chemical agents such as copper sulfate and cobalt chloride, may cooperate in regulating the autophagy hub genes. Furthermore, classical monocytes may play a central role in severe COVID-19.  We suggest that autophagy plays a crucial role in severe COVID-19. This study might facilitate a more profound knowledge of the biological characteristics and progression of COVID-19 and the development of novel therapeutic approaches to achieve a breakthrough in the current COVID-19 pandemic.'} |

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by the inability to match cardiac output with metabolic needs. Research on regulatory mechanism of fibrosis-related genes in patients with HF is very limited. In order to understand the mechanism of fibrosis in the development and progression of HF, fibrosis -related hub genes in HF are screened and verified.  RNA sequencing data was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Thereafter, fibrosis-related genes were obtained from the GSEA database and that associated with HF were screened out. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis was carried out to analyze the biological function of fibrosis-related DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of hub genes was constructed  the STRING database. Moreover, the diagnostic value of hub genes for HF was confirmed using ROC curves and expression analysis. Finally, quantitative real time PCR was used to detect the expression levels of mRNAs.  A total of 3, 469 DEGs were identified closely related to HF, and 1, 187 fibrosis-related DEGs were obtained and analyzed for GO and KEGG enrichment. The enrichment results of fibrosis-related DEGs were consistent with that of DEGs. A total of 10 hub genes (PPARG, KRAS, JUN, IL10, TLR4, STAT3, CXCL8, CCL2, IL6, IL1β) were selected  the PPI network. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was estimated in the test cohort, and 6 genes (PPARG, KRAS, JUN, IL10, TLR4, STAT3) with AUC more than 0.7 were identified as diagnosis genes. Moreover, miRNA-mRNA and TF-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed. Finally, quantitative real time PCR revealed these 6 genes may be used as the potential diagnostic biomarkers of HF.

Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a widespread persistent environmental pollutant implicated in nephrotoxicity with altered metabolism, carcinogenesis, and fibrosis potential. We studied the underlying epigenetic mechanism involving transcription factors of PFOS-induced kidney injury. A 14-day orally dosed mouse model was chosen to study acute influences . Messenger RNA expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to elucidate the relationship between epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, kidney disease, and metabolism homeostasis. PFOS was found to accumulate in mouse kidney in a dose-dependent manner. Kidney injury markers  and  increased in expression significantly. Transcription factors, including , and  were upregulated, while  and  were downregulated. Furthermore, global DNA methylation levels decreased and the gene expression of histone demethylases  and  were upregulated.

Liver cancer is the sixth most frequently diagnosed primary malignancy and ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide in 2020. ER stress also plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of malignancies. In the current study, we aimed to construct an endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes (ERGs) signature to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC. Differentially expressed ERGs (DE-ERGs) were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-LIHC cohort) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC-LIRI-JP cohort) databases. The prognostic gene signature was identified by the univariate Cox regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated by utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Gene set variant analysis (GSVA) was performed to explore the underlying biological processes and signaling pathways. CIBERPORT and single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) were implemented to estimate the immune status between the different risk groups. A total of 113 DE-ERGs were identified between 50 normal samples and 365 HCC samples in the TCGA-LIHC cohort, and 48 DE-ERGs were associated with OS through the univariate Cox regression. A six DE-ERGs (, , , , , ) signature was constructed and classified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The risk score was an independent prognostic indicator for OS (HR > 1,  < 0.001). The function enrichment analysis indicated that cell cycle, RNA degradation, protein localization, and cell division were the main biological processes. The high-risk group had higher immune cell infiltration levels than those of the low-risk group. We predicted the response to targeted therapy in high- and low-risk patients with HCC and found that the high-risk patients were more sensitive to pazopanib. At last, we verified the expression of the six gene patterns in HCC tissues by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. This signature may be a potential tool to provide a choice for prognosis prediction and personal management of patients with HCC.'} |
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of chronic liver disease. Using a proxy NAFLD definition of chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (cALT) levels without other liver diseases, we performed a multiancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) including 90,408 cALT cases and 128,187 controls. Seventy-seven loci exceeded genome-wide significance, including 25 without prior NAFLD or alanine aminotransferase associations, with one additional locus identified in European American-only and two in African American-only analyses (P\u2009<\u20095 × 10). External replication in histology-defined NAFLD cohorts (7,397 cases and 56,785 controls) or radiologic imaging cohorts (n\u2009=\u200944,289) replicated 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P\u2009<\u20096.5 × 10), of which 9 were new (TRIB1, PPARG, MTTP, SERPINA1, FTO, IL1RN, COBLL1, APOH and IFI30). Pleiotropy analysis showed that 61 of 77 multiancestry and all 17 replicated SNPs were jointly associated with metabolic and/or inflammatory traits, revealing a complex model of genetic architecture. Our approach integrating cALT, histology and imaging reveals new insights into genetic liability to NAFLD.'} |

| Intramuscular fat development is regulated by a series of complicated processes, with non-coding RNA (ncRNA) such as microRNA (miRNA) having a critical role during intramuscular preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation in pigs. In the present study, the miRNA expression profiles of intramuscular preadipocytes from the longissimus dorsi muscle of Chinese Guizhou Congjiang Xiang pigs were detected by RNA-seq during various differentiation stages, namely, day 0 (D0), day 4 (D4), and day 8 (D8). A total of 67, 95, and 16 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were detected between D4 and D0, D8 and D0, and D8 and D4, respectively. According to gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes analysis, target genes of DE miRNAs were enriched in categories and pathways related to lipid metabolic process, lipid biosynthetic process, as well as the PI3K-Akt, AMPK, and MAPK signalling pathways. Notably, miR-148a-3p was differentially expressed, with highest expressed abundance in D0, D4, and D8. Overexpression of miR-148a-3p in intramuscular preadipocytes increased cell proliferation and differentiation, and decreased apoptosis, in comparison to the knockdown of miR-148a-3p in intramuscular preadipocytes. Luciferase activity assays, quantitative polymerase-chain reaction, and western blot analysis confirmed that miR-148a-3p regulated adipogenesis by repressing PPARGC1A expression. Accordingly, the effect of miR-148a-3p mimic was attenuated by overexpression of PPARGC1A intramuscular preadipocytes. Furthermore, miR-148a-3p promoted intramuscular preadipocyte differentiation by inhibiting the AMPK/ACC/CPT1C signalling pathway. Taken together, we identified expression profiles of miRNAs in intramuscular preadipocytes and determined that miR-148a-3p acted as a promoter of adipogenesis. |
The role of breastfeeding in modulating epigenetic factors has been suggested as a possible mechanism conferring its benefits on child development but it lacks evidence.

| Integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and gene expression studies in the form of a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) has the potential to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology. Here we present a method, METRO, that can leverage gene expression data collected from multiple genetic ancestries to enhance TWASs. METRO incorporates expression prediction models constructed in different genetic ancestries through a likelihood-based inference framework, producing calibrated p values with substantially improved TWAS power. We illustrate the benefits of METRO in both simulations and applications to seven complex traits and diseases obtained from four GWASs. These GWASs include two of primarily European ancestry (n = 188,577 and 339,226) and two of primarily African ancestry (n = 42,752 and 23,827). In the real data applications, we leverage gene expression data measured on 1,032 African Americans and 801 European Americans from the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study to identify a substantially larger number of gene-trait associations as compared to existing TWAS approaches. The benefits of METRO are most prominent in applications to GWASs of African ancestry where the sample size is much smaller than GWASs of European ancestry and where a more powerful TWAS method is crucial. Among the identified associations are high-density lipoprotein-associated genes including PLTP and PPARG that are critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis and the type II diabetes-associated gene MAPT that supports microtubule-associated protein tau as a key component underlying impaired insulin secretion. |
Osteoporosis (OP) is a serious and common bone metabolic disease with bone mass loss and bone microarchitectural deterioration. The OSTEOWONDER capsule is clinically used to treat OP. However, the potential regulatory mechanism of the OSTEOWONDER capsule in treatment of OP remains largely unknown.  The bioactive compounds of herbs and their targets were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) database. The speculative targets of OP were screened out based on GeneCards, DisGeNET, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases. The gene modules and hub genes of OP were identified using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Then, an herb-compound-target network was constructed based on the above analyses. The biological function of targets was subsequently investigated, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify hub targets of OP. Finally, molecular docking was performed to explore the interaction between compounds and targets.  A total of 148 compounds of eight herbs and the corresponding 273 targets were identified based on the TCMSP database. A total of 4,929 targets of OP were obtained based on GeneCards, DisGeNET, and OMIM databases. In addition, six gene modules and 4,235 hub genes of OP were screened out based on WGCNA. Generally, an herb-compound-target network, including eight herbs, 84 compounds, and 58 targets, was constructed to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of the OSTEOWONDER capsule for OP. The biofunction analysis indicated 58 targets mainly associated with the bone metabolism, stimulation response, and immune response. EGFR, HIF1A, MAPK8, IL6, and PPARG were identified as the hub therapeutic targets in OP. Moreover, the interaction between EGFR, HIF1A, MAPK8, IL6, PPARG, and the corresponding compounds (quercetin and nobiletin) was analyzed using molecular docking.  Our finding discovered the possible therapeutic mechanisms of the OSTEOWONDER capsule and supplied the potential therapeutic targets for OP.'} |
| The molecular mechanism of AAA formation is still poorly understood and has not been fully elucidated. The study was designed to identify the immune-related genes, immune-RAS in AAA using bioinformatics methods. The GSE175683 datasets were downloaded from the GEO database. The DEseq2 software was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). SUVA pipeline was used to quantify AS events and RAS events. KOBAS 2.0 server was used to identify GO terms and KEGG pathways to sort out functional categories of DEGs. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used with the default parameter for estimating immune cell fractions. Nine samples from GSE175683 were used to construct the co-disturbed network between expression of SFs and splicing ratio of RAS events. PCA analysis was performed by R package factoextra to show the clustering of samples, and the pheatmap package in R was used to perform the clustering based on Euclidean distance. The results showed that there were 3,541 genes significantly differentially expressed, of which 177 immune-related genes were upregulated and 48 immune-related genes were downregulated between the WT and WTA group. Immune-RAS events were mainly alt5P and IR events, and about 60% of it was complex splicing events in AAA. The WT group and the WTA group can be clearly distinguished in the first principal component by using the splicing ratio of immune-RAS events. Two downregulated genes, Nr4a1 and Nr4a2, and eight upregulated genes, Adipor2, Akt2, Bcl3, Dhx58, Pparg, Ptgds, Sytl1, and Vegfa were identified among the immune-related genes with RAS and DEGs. Eighteen differentially expressed SFs were identified and displayed by heatmap. The proportion of different types of cells and ratio of the average ratio of different cells were quite different. Both M1 and M2 types of macrophages and plasma cells were upregulated, while M0 type was downregulated in AAA. The proportion of plasma cells in the WTA group had sharply increased. There is a correlation between SF expression and immune cells/immune-RAS. Sf3b1, a splicing factor with significantly different expression, was selected to bind on a mass of immune-related genes. In conclusion, our results showed that immune-related genes, immune-RAS, and SFs by genome-wide identification were involved in AAA. |
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health issue, and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) plays an important role in the cardiovascular system. Previous studies have examined one important exon polymorphism, Pro12Ala, in PPARG with respect to mortality of CKD patients, but the results were inconsistent and current evidence is insufficient to support a strong conclusion. This study aimed to examine the correlation between Pro12Ala gene polymorphism and mortality among Asians with CKD by trial sequential analysis (TSA).  The research was divided into observational research and meta-analysis. For the cohort study, 767 subjects from dialysis centers in Taipei were selected as samples, and tracked from December 2015 to February 2017. For the meta-analysis, relevant literature from "PubMed" and "Embase" databases (until December 2016), was searched and TSA was used to verify the results. In order to achieve the best evidence hierarchies, our retrospective cohort study was added to the meta-analysis and the TSA.  The combined sample size for Asian was 1,685 after adding our cohort study, and there was no significant correlation between PPARG Pro12Ala and mortality by the allele model (RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.39-1.83, I = 79.3%). Under the parameter setting with the RR value of 1.5, TSA estimation presented that the cumulative sample size entered into the futility area, and it confirmed the conclusion in this study.  We found that PPARG Pro12Ala gene polymorphism was not related to mortality in CKD Asians patients, and validated our conclusion using TSA after adding our sample.'} |
Paratuberculosis in cattle causes substantial economic losses to the dairy industry. Exploring functional genes and corresponding regulatory pathways related to resistance or susceptibility to paratuberculosis is essential to the breeding of disease resistance in cattle. Co-analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles is a critically important approach to understand potential regulatory mechanism underlying the development of diseases. In this study, we characterized the profiles of DNA methylation of jejunum from nine Holstein cows in clinical, subclinical, and healthy groups using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). The average methylation level in functional regions was 29.95% in the promoter, 29.65% in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), 68.24% in exons, 71.55% in introns, and 72.81% in the 3' UTR. A total of 3,911, 4,336, and 4,094 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were detected in clinical vs. subclinical, clinical vs. healthy, and subclinical vs. healthy comparative group, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) and analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) showed that these DMGs were significantly enriched in specific biological processes related to immune response, such as Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, wnt, TNF, MAPK, ECM-receptor interaction, cellular senescence, calcium, and chemokine signaling pathways ( value <0.05). The integration of information about DMGs, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and biological functions suggested nine genes , , , , , , ,  and  as promising candidates related to resistance/susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). This study reports on the high-resolution DNA methylation landscapes of the jejunum methylome across three conditions (clinical, subclinical, and healthy) in dairy cows. Our investigations integrated different sources of information about DMGs, DEGs, and pathways, enabling us to find nine functional genes that might have potential application in resisting paratuberculosis in dairy cattle."} |

The South African Mutton Merino (SAMM), a dual-purpose (meat and wool) sheep breed, is characterized by its excellent performance on growth, carcass traits and meat quality compared to other fine-wool Merino breeds. Nowadays, the SAMM breed has been widely used to cross with commercial and indigenous fine-wool or coarse-wool breeds to improve the growth and meat performance in many countries. To date, however, little is known about the genetic basis for its prominent characteristics. In this study, whole-genome sequences of 10 SAMM were sequenced and the selection signatures were analyzed together with those of 39 Australian Merino and Chinese Merino (wool-type Merino) by F , iHS, and XP-EHH methods. In total, 313\xa0genes in 277 regions were identified by at least 2\xa0methods with the signal of selection and 21 of them were identified by all three methods. We highlighted a list of interesting genes, including GHR, LCORL, SMO, NCAPG, DCC, IBSP, PPARGC1A, PACRGL, PRDM5, XYLB, AHCYL2, TEFM, AFG1L, and FAM184B, which have been shown to be involved in growth, carcass traits, and meat quality by previous studies. Herein, GHR, encoding a transmembrane receptor for growth hormone, is the most notable one. We report the first study on selection signatures analysis of SAMM at whole-genome sequence level. These results provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the growth and carcass traits in SAMM.'} |
The clinical efficacy of osteoporosis therapy is unsatisfactory. However, there is currently no gold standard for the treatment of osteoporosis. Recent studies have indicated that a switch from osteogenic to adipogenic differentiation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) induces osteoporosis. This study aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in this process and to identify key genes involved in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in hMSCs to provide new insights for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.  Microarray and bioinformatics approaches were used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, and the biological functions and pathways of these genes were analyzed. Hub genes were identified, and the miRNA-mRNA interaction networks of these hub genes were constructed.  In an optimized microenvironment, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) could promote osteogenic differentiation and inhibit adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. According to our study, 98 upregulated genes involved in osteogenic differentiation and 66 downregulated genes involved in adipogenic differentiation were identified, and associated biological functions and pathways were analyzed. Based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, the hub genes of the upregulated genes (CTGF, IGF1, BMP2, MMP13, TGFB3, MMP3, and SERPINE1) and the hub genes of the downregulated genes (PPARG, TIMP3, ANXA1, ADAMTS5, AGTR1, CXCL12, and CEBPA) were identified, and statistical analysis revealed significant differences. In addition, 36 miRNAs derived from the upregulated hub genes were screened, as were 17 miRNAs derived from the downregulated hub genes. Hub miRNAs (hsa-miR-27a/b-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-98-5p, and hsa-miR-130b-3p) coregulated both osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation factors.  The upregulated hub genes identified are potential targets for osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs, whereas the downregulated hub genes are potential targets for adipogenic differentiation. These hub genes and miRNAs play important roles in adipogenesis and osteogenesis of hMSCs. They may be related to the prevention and treatment not only of osteoporosis but also of obesity.'} |
The mechanism of environmental factors in Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) remains unknown. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and protein alterations of selenium- and T-2 toxin-responsive genes to provide new evidence of chondrocytic damage in KBD. This study sampled the cubital venous blood of 258 subjects including 129 sex-matched KBD patients and 129 healthy controls for SNP detection. We applied an additive model, a dominant model, and a recessive model to identify significant SNPs. We then used the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to select selenium- and T-2 toxin-responsive genes with the candidate SNP loci. Finally, immunohistochemistry was applied to verify the protein expression of candidate genes in knee cartilage obtained from 15 subjects including 5 KBD, 5 osteoarthritis (OA), and 5 healthy controls. Forty-nine SNPs were genotyped in the current study. The C allele of rs6494629 was less frequent in KBD than in the controls (OR = 0.63,  = 0.011). Based on the CTD database, PPARG, ADAM12, IL6, SMAD3, and TIMP2 were identified to interact with selenium, sodium selenite, and T-2 toxin. KBD was found to be significantly associated with rs12629751 of PPARG (additive model: OR = 0.46,  = 0.012; dominant model: OR = 0.45,  = 0.049; recessive model: OR = 0.18,  = 0.018), rs1871054 of ADAM12 (dominant model: OR = 2.19,  = 0.022), rs1800796 of IL6 (dominant model: OR = 0.30,  = 0.003), rs6494629 of SMAD3 (additive model: OR = 0.65,  = 0.019; dominant model: OR = 0.52,  = 0.012), and rs4789936 of TIMP2 (recessive model: OR = 5.90,  = 0.024). Immunohistochemistry verified significantly upregulated PPARG, ADAM12, SMAD3, and TIMP2 in KBD compared with OA and normal controls ( < 0.05). Genetic polymorphisms of PPARG, ADAM12, SMAD3, and TIMP2 may contribute to the risk of KBD. These genes could promote the pathogenesis of KBD by disturbing ECM homeostasis.'} |

Breast cancer (BRCA) is the most frequent malignancy. Identification of potential biomarkers could help to better understand and combat the disease at early stages.  We selected the overlapping genes of differential expressed genes and genes in BRCA-highly correlated modules by Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) in TCGA and GEO data and performed KEGG and GO enrichment. PPARG was achieved from Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis and prognostic analysis. TIMER, UALCAN, GEO, TCGA, and western blot analysis were used to validate the expression of PPARG in BRCA. PPARG was further analyzed by DNA methylation, immune parameters, and tumor mutation burden.  Among 381 overlapping genes, the lipid metabolic process was identified as highly enriched pathways in BRCA by TCGA and GEO data. When the prognostic analysis of 10 core genes by PPI network was performed, results revealed that high expression of PPARG was significantly correlated to a better prognosis. PPARG was lesser expression in BRCA according to TIMER, UALCAN, GEO, TCGA, and western blot in both mRNA level and protein level. PPARG had several high DNA methylation level sites and the methylation level is negatively correlated to expression. PPARG is also correlated to TNM stages, tumor microenvironment, and tumor burden.  Findings of our study identified the PPARG as a potential biomarker by confirming its low expression in BRCA and its correlation to prognosis. Moreover, its correlation to DNA methylation and tumor microenvironment may guide new therapeutic strategies for BRCA patients.'} |
The manuscript aims to explore the relationship between power performance and SNPs of Chinese elite athletes and to create polygenic models.  One hundred three Chinese elite athletes were divided into the power group ( = 60) and endurance group ( = 43) by their sports event. Best standing long jump (SLJ) and standing vertical jump (SVJ) were collected. Twenty SNPs were genotyped by SNaPshot. Genotype distribution and allele frequency were compared between groups. Additional genotype data of 125 Chinese elite athletes were used to verify the screened SNPs. Predictive and identifying models were established by multivariate logistic regression analysis.  ACTN3 (rs1815739), ADRB3 (rs4994), CNTFR (rs2070802), and PPARGC1A (rs8192678) were significantly different in genotype distribution or allele frequency between groups ( < 0.05). The predictive model consisted of ACTN3 (rs1815739), ADRB3 (rs4994), and PPARGC1A (rs8192678), the area under curve (AUC) of which was 0.736. The identifying model consisted of body mass index (BMI), standing vertical jump (SVJ), ACTN3, ADRB3, and PPARGC1A, the area under curve (AUC) of which was 0.854. Based on the two models, nomograms were created to visualize the results.  Two models can be used for talent identification in Chinese athletes, among which the predictive model can be used in adolescent athletes to predict development potential of power performance and the identifying one can be used in elite athletes to evaluate power athletic status. These can be applied quickly and visually by using nomograms. When the score is more than the 130 or 148 cutoff, it suggests that the athlete has a good development potential or a high level for power performance.'} |
Growth is a complex trait with moderate to high heritability in livestock and must be described by the longitudinal data measured over multiple time points. Therefore, the used phenotype in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of growth traits could be either the measures at the preselected time point or the fitted parameters of whole growth trajectory. A promising alternative approach was recently proposed that combined the fitting of growth curves and estimation of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects into single-step nonlinear mixed model (NMM). In this study, we collected the body weights at 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, and 84 days of age for 401 animals in a crossbred population of meat rabbits and compared five fitting models of growth curves (Logistic, Gompertz, Brody, Von Bertalanffy, and Richards). The logistic model was preferably selected and subjected to GWAS using the approach of single-step NMM, which was based on 87,704 genome-wide SNPs. A total of 45 significant SNPs distributed on five chromosomes were found to simultaneously affect the two growth parameters of mature weight (A) and maturity rate (K). However, no SNP was found to be independently associated with either A or K. Seven positional genes, including , , , , , , and , were suggested to be candidates affecting growth performances in meat rabbits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of GWAS based on single-step NMM for longitudinal traits in rabbits, which also revealed the genetic architecture of growth traits that are helpful in implementing genome selection.'} |

| Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) involves necrosis of bone and bone marrow of the femoral head caused by ischemia with unknown etiology. Previous genetic studies on ONFH failed to produce consistent results, presumably because ONFH has various causes with different genetic backgrounds and the underlying diseases confounded the associations. Steroid-associated ONFH (S-ONFH) accounts for one-half of all ONFH, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a representative disease underlying S-ONFH. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic risk factors for S-ONFH in patients with SLE. We conducted a two-staged GWAS on 636 SLE patients with S-ONFH and 95 588 non-SLE controls. Among the novel loci identified, we determined S-ONFH-specific loci by comparing allele frequencies between SLE patients without S-ONFH and non-SLE controls. We also used Korean datasets comprising 148 S-ONFH cases and 37 015 controls to assess overall significance. We evaluated the functional annotations of significant variants by in silico analyses. The Japanese GWAS identified 4 significant loci together with 12 known SLE susceptibility loci. The four significant variants showed comparable effect sizes on S-ONFH compared with SLE controls and non-SLE controls. Three of the four loci, MIR4293/MIR1265 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.99, P-value = 1.1 × 10-9)], TRIM49/NAALAD2 (OR = 1.65, P-value = 4.8 × 10-8) and MYO16 (OR = 3.91, P-value = 4.9 × 10-10), showed significant associations in the meta-analysis with Korean datasets. Bioinformatics analyses identified MIR4293, NAALAD2 and MYO16 as candidate causal genes. MIR4293 regulates a PPARG-related adipogenesis pathway relevant to S-ONFH. We identified three novel susceptibility loci for S-ONFH in SLE. |

R's Limma package was used to identify differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) between the normal and GIC samples group (4- and 16-h). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analysis for the mRNAs in the constructed GIC lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA regulation network was implemented. A total of 1665 and 1443 DERs were obtained in the 4- and 16-h group, respectively. At two time points, 256 overlapping DERs were identified, of which 210 (17 lncRNAs and 203 mRNAs) had significant differential expression (4 down- and 206 up-regulated). A total of 534 co-expressed ligation pairs (all up-regulated) were obtained. A ceRNA regulation network was constructed.

| Goldenhar syndrome or oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a complex developmental disorder characterized by asymmetric ear anomalies, hemifacial microsomia, ocular and vertebral defects. We aimed at identifying and characterizing a new gene associated with OAVS. Two affected brothers with OAVS were analyzed by exome sequencing that revealed a missense variant (p.(Asn358Ser)) in the EYA3 gene. EYA3 screening was then performed in 122 OAVS patients that identified the same variant in one individual from an unrelated family. Segregation assessment in both families showed incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. We investigated this variant in cellular models to determine its pathogenicity and demonstrated an increased half-life of the mutated protein without impact on its ability to dephosphorylate H2AFX following DNA repair pathway induction. Proteomics performed on this cellular model revealed four significantly predicted upstream regulators which are PPARGC1B, YAP1, NFE2L2 and MYC. Moreover, eya3 knocked-down zebrafish embryos developed specific craniofacial abnormalities corroborating previous animal models and supporting its involvement in the OAVS. Additionally, EYA3 gene expression was deregulated in vitro by retinoic acid exposure. EYA3 is the second recurrent gene identified to be associated with OAVS. Moreover, based on protein interactions and related diseases, we suggest the DNA repair as a key molecular pathway involved in craniofacial development. |
| Obesity and overweight are worldwide public health problems with an evident genetic predisposition that is still poorly understood. In addition, great variability has been described across populations. In this work, we analyzed the association of variants in four genes: PPARG (rs1801282), PPARGC1A (rs8192678), FTO (rs9939609) and MC4R (rs17782313) with overweight and obesity in a large sample of the Brazilian population. The case-control study involved 4084 individuals (1844 with overweight or obesity; and 2240 with normal BMI). Genotyping was performed by quantitative PCR. MC4R rs17782313-C was associated with obesity (OR = 1.27, p = 0.038) and when stratifying by sex associated only in women (OR = 1.36, p = 0.030). FTO rs9939609-A allele was associated with overweight however for women it represented a risk factor (OR = 1.24, p = 0.034) and for men, a protective factor (OR = 0.68, p = 0.033). PPARG was the strongest associated gene, with both overweight and obesity, and this association was also restricted to women (rs1801282-GG OR = 1.46, p = 0.027). The combined effect of the three risk alleles on overweight and obesity had an OR of 1.65 (p = 0.008) and when stratifying by sex again it was significant only in females (OR = 1.95, p = 0.0028). Our findings indicate that the three genes play a significant role in predisposing to overweight and/or obesity in the Brazilian population, reaching together a relatively high impact on these traits.

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a promising antiobesity agent, but its effects on melanocortin obesity are unknown. Sex is an important biological variable that must be considered when conducting preclinical studies; however, in laboratory animal models, the pharmacological effects of FGF21 are well documented only for male mice. We aimed at investigating whether FGF21 affects metabolism in male and female mice with the lethal yellow (A) mutation, which results in MC4R blockage and obesity development. Obese C57Bl-A male and female mice were administered subcutaneously for 10 days with vehicle or FGF21 (1 mg per 1 kg). Food intake (FI), body weight (BW), blood parameters, and gene expression in the liver, muscles, brown adipose tissue, subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissues, and hypothalamus were measured. FGF21 action strongly depended on the sex of the animals. In the males, FGF21 decreased BW and insulin blood levels without affecting FI. In the females, FGF21 increased FI and liver weight, but did not affect BW. In control A-mice, expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (Ppargc1a, Cpt1, Pck1, G6p, Slc2a2) in the liver and genes involved in lipogenesis (Pparg, Lpl, Slc2a4) in visceral adipose tissue was higher in females than in males, and FGF21 administration inhibited the expression of these genes in females.

A total of 95 women diagnosed with BC as cases and 119 controls were genotyped for PPARgamma polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. The ProPro genotype and T161 allele were associated with an increased risk of BC comparing with the Ala12 allele and CC161 genotype, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

| The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is accompanied by alterations in biological function and signaling pathways regulated through complex molecular mechanisms. A number of regulatory factors, including transcription factors (TFs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs, including lncRNAs and miRNAs), have been implicated in DN; however, it is unclear how the interactions among these regulatory factors contribute to the development of DN pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a network-based analysis to decipher interplays between TFs and ncRNAs regulating progression of DN by combining omics data with regulatory factor-target information. To accomplish this, we identified differential expression programs of mRNAs and miRNAs during early DN (EDN) and established DN. We then uncovered putative interactive connections among miRNA-mRNA, lncRNA-miRNA, and lncRNA-mRNA implicated in transcriptional control. This led to the identification of two lncRNAs (MALAT1 and NEAT1) and the three TFs (NF-κB, NFE2L2, and PPARG) that likely cooperate with a set of miRNAs to modulate EDN and DN target genes. The results highlight how crosstalk among TFs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs regulate the expression of genes both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, and our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis and pathogenesis of progressive DN. |

Because of insufficient information available, unsupervised clustering, for example, -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection, is usually employed to obtain low-dimensional embedding that can help to understand cell-cell relationship. One possible drawback of this strategy is that the outcome is highly dependent upon genes selected for the usage of clustering. In order to fulfill this requirement, there are many methods that performed unsupervised gene selection. In this study, a tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) was applied to the integration of two scRNA-seq expression profiles that measure human and mouse midbrain development.

Additionally, mice carrying an orthologous human Glut10G128E variant (Glut10G128E mice) with compromised GLUT10 function have reduced adipogenesis, reduced WAT development and increased susceptibility to HFD-induced metabolic dysregulation. We further demonstrate that GLUT10 is highly expressed in preadipocytes, where it regulates intracellular ascorbic acid levels and adipogenesis. In this context, GLUT10 increases ascorbic acid-dependent DNA demethylation and the expression of key adipogenic genes, Cebpa and Pparg. Together, our data show GLUT10 regulates adipogenesis via ascorbic acid-dependent DNA demethylation to benefit proper WAT development and protect mice against HFD-induced metabolic dysregulation. Our findings suggest that SLC2A10 may be an important HFD-associated susceptibility locus for T2DM. |

| High blood cholesterol concentration, mainly caused by high dietary cholesterol, is a potential risk factor for human health. Dairy products are important sources of human dietary cholesterol intake. Therefore, monitoring bovine milk cholesterol concentration is important for human health benefit. Genetic selection for improvement of cow milk cholesterol content requires understanding of the genetics of milk cholesterol. For this purpose, we performed analyses of additive and dominance effects of 126 potentially functional SNPs within 43 candidate genes with milk cholesterol content [expressed as mg of cholesterol in 100 g of fat (CHL_fat) or in 100 mg of milk (CHL_milk)]. The additive and dominance effects of SNPs rs380643365 in AGPAT1 (P = 0.04) and rs134357240 in SOAT1 (P = 0.035) genes associated significantly with CHL_fat.

| The transcription factor nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) is a regulator of brown adipocyte differentiation. Here we show that the C-terminal 17 amino acid residues of NFIA (which we call pro#3 domain) are required for the transcriptional activity of NFIA. Full-length NFIA-but not deletion mutant lacking pro#3 domain-rescued impaired expression of PPARγ, the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis and impaired adipocyte differentiation in NFIA-knockout cells. Mechanistically, the ability of NFIA to penetrate chromatin and bind to the crucial Pparg enhancer is mediated through pro#3 domain. However, the deletion mutant still binds to Myod1 enhancer to repress expression of MyoD, the master transcriptional regulator of myogenesis as well as proximally transcribed non-coding RNA called DRReRNA, via competition with KLF5 in terms of enhancer binding, leading to suppression of myogenic gene program. Therefore, the negative effect of NFIA on the myogenic gene program is, at least partly, independent of the positive effect on PPARγ expression and its downstream adipogenic gene program. These results uncover multiple ways of action of NFIA to ensure optimal regulation of brown and beige adipocyte differentiation. |
| Meat quality improvement is of great interest to researchers in pig breeding and many researchers have identified abundant associated quantitative trait loci, genes and polymorphisms (QTXs) for fat-related traits. However, it is challenging to determine credible candidate genes from a mass of associations. The efficiency of identification of credible candidate genes in these QTXs is restricted by limited integration analyses of data from multiple omics. In this study, we constructed a 'candidate gene map' of fat-related traits in pigs based on published literature and the latest genome. In total, 6,861 QTXs, which covered 9,323 genes on the pig genome, were used. Combining the QTX hotspots and pathway analysis, we identified 180 candidate genes that may regulate the fat-related traits, and choose PNPLA2, PPARG, SREBF1, ACACA, PPARD and PPARA as credible candidate genes. In addition, we discussed the importance of incorporating transcriptome data and genomic data in causal gene identification, and the multi-omics information can effectively improve the credibility of identified candidate genes. |

| African Americans (AA) have lower prevalence of alcohol dependence and higher subjective response to alcohol than European Americans. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genes/variants associated with alcohol dependence specifically in AA; however, the sample sizes are still not large enough to detect variants with small effects. Admixture mapping is an alternative way to identify alcohol dependence genes/variants that may be unique to AA. In this study, we performed the first admixture mapping of DSM-IV alcohol dependence diagnosis, DSM-IV alcohol dependence criterion count, and two scores from the self-rating of effects of ethanol (SRE) as measures of response to alcohol: the first five times of using alcohol (SRE-5) and average of SRE across three times (SRE-T). Findings revealed a region on chromosome 4 that was genome-wide significant for SRE-5 (p value = 4.18E-05). Fine mapping did not identify a single causal variant to be associated with SRE-5; instead, conditional analysis concluded that multiple variants collectively explained the admixture mapping signal. PPARGC1A, a gene that has been linked to alcohol consumption in previous studies, is located in this region. Our finding suggests that admixture mapping is a useful tool to identify genes/variants that may have been missed by current GWAS approaches in admixed populations. |

| The nuclear receptors known as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG) are lipid-activated transcription factors that have emerged as key regulators of inflammation. PPARG ligands have been shown to have an anti-proliferative effect on a variety of cancers. These ligands can induce apoptosis via TP53 (Tumor protein p53) or ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) (EPHB2) pathways. However, the exact mechanism is not known. PPAR, a type II nuclear hormone receptor deserves attention as a selective target for radiotherapy. Our study examines the potential of selective agonism of PPARG for radiation therapy in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We found that the overexpression of PPARG protein as well as its induction using the agonist, rosiglitazone was able to stimulate radiation-induced cell death in otherwise radio resistant NSCLC A549 cell line. This cell death was apoptotic and was found to be BAX (BCL2 associated X) mediated. The treatment also inhibited radiation-induced AKT (Protein Kinase B) phosphorylation. Interestingly, the ionising radiation (IR) induced apoptosis was found to be inversely related to TP53 levels. A relatively significant increase in the levels of radiation induced apoptosis was observed in H1299 cells (TP53 null) under PPARG overexpression condition further supporting the inverse relationship between apoptosis and TP53 levels. The combination of PPARG agonist and radiation was able to induce apoptosis at a radiation dose at which A549 and H1299 are radioresistant, thus confirming the potential of the combinatorial strategy. Taken together, PPARG agonism was found to invigorate the radiosensitising effect and hence its use in combination with radiotherapy is expected to enhance sensitivity in otherwise resistant cancer types. |

IMF content affects the tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of chicken. An increasing number of studies are focusing on the functions of lncRNAs in adipocyte differentiation. However, little is known about lncRNAs associated with intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. In the present study, we focused on an up-regulated lncRNA during intramuscular adipogenetic differentiation, which we named intramuscular fat-associated long non-coding RNA (IMFNCR). IMFNCR promotes intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. In-depth analyses showed that IMFNCR acts as a molecular sponge for miR-128-3p and miR-27b-3p and that PPARG is a direct target of miR-128-3p and miR-27b-3p in chicken. High-fat and high-protein diet inhibited chicken IMFNCR level . Moreover, IMFNCR level was positively correlated with PPARG mRNA level in chicken breast muscle tissues, a vital corollary to ceRNA function. Altogether, our research showed that IMFNCR acts as a ceRNA to sequester miR-128-3p and miR-27b-3p, leading to heightened PPARG expression, and thus promotes intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. Taken together, our findings may contribute to a more thorough understanding of chicken IMF deposition and the improvement of poultry meat quality.'} |
| There is growing evidence that molecular subtypes (e.g. luminal and basal subtypes) affect the prognosis and treatment response in patients with muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer (invasive urothelial carcinoma, iUC). Modeling these subtypes in pre-clinical animal studies is essential, but it is challenging to produce these subtypes, along with other critical host and tumor features, in experimentally-induced animal models. This study was conducted to determine if luminal and basal molecular subtypes are present in naturally-occurring canine iUC, a cancer that mimics the human condition in other key aspects. RNA sequencing was performed on 29 canine treatment naive iUC tissue samples and on four normal canine bladder mucosal samples. Data were aligned to CanFam 3.1, and differentially expressed genes were identified. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed two distinct groups (n = 13, n = 16). When genes that distinguish basal and luminal subtypes in human cancer (n = 2015) were used to probe genes differentially expressed between normal canine bladder and iUC, 829 enriched signature genes were identified. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed two distinct groups comprised of 18 luminal subtype tumors and 11 basal subtype tumors. The enriched genes included MMP9, SERPINE2, CAV1, KRT14, and RASA3 in basal tumors, and PPARG, LY6E, CTSE, CDK3, and TBX2 in luminal tumors. In supervised clustering, additional genes of importance in human iUC were identified in canine iUC associated with claudin-low and infiltrated tumors. A smaller panel of genes (n = 60) was identified that distinguished canine luminal and basal iUC with overall 93.1% accuracy. Immune signature patterns similar to those in human iUC were also identified with the greatest enrichment of immune genes being in the basal subtype tumors. These findings provide additional compelling evidence that naturally-occurring canine iUC is a highly relevant and much needed model of human iUC for translational research. |

Epigenetic regulation is often suggested as an important factor shaping the phenotype, but its association with growth can be highly context- and species-dependent. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in epigenetic regulation of growth in fish are poorly understood. We have used reduced representation bisulphite sequencing to determine the genome-wide CpG methylation patterns in male and female Nile tilapia of different sizes but at the same early stage of domestication. The average CpG methylation level in the reduced genome representation was 63% across groups but many sites displayed group-specific methylation patterns. The number of differentially methylated (DM) CpGs was much higher when the interaction between sex and weight was included rather than when these factors were considered separately. There were 1128 DM CpGs between large and small females and 970 DM CpGs between large and small males. We have found many growth-related genes associated with DM CpGs, namely  and  in females and  and  in males. Only 5% of CpG locations associated with growth were common to both sexes. In particular, the autophagy-related gene  displayed a high association of methylation with growth exclusively in males. The sexually dimorphic association between  methylation and growth may uncover novel metabolic mechanisms at play during mouth brooding in Nile tilapia females. Taken together, our data suggest that epigenetic regulation of growth in Nile tilapia involves different gene networks in males and females.'} |

However, the relative contributions of genomic regions to observed genetic variations have not been well explored using sequence level single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information. Here, imputed sequence level SNP data (11,278,153 SNPs) of 2109 Hanwoo steers (Korean native cattle) were partitioned according to functional annotation, chromosome, and minor allele frequency (MAF). Genomic relationship matrices (GRMs) were constructed for each classified region and fitted in the model both separately and together for carcass weight (CWT), eye muscle area (EMA), backfat thickness (BFT), and marbling score (MS) traits. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify significantly associated variants in genic and exon regions using a linear mixed model, and the genetic contribution of each exonic SNP was determined using a Bayesian mixture model. Considering all SNPs together, the heritability estimates for CWT, EMA, BFT, and MS were 0.57 ± 0.05, 0.46 ± 0.05, 0.45 ± 0.05, and 0.49 ± 0.05, respectively, which reflected substantial genomic contributions. Joint analysis revealed that the variance explained by each chromosome was proportional to its physical length with weak linear relationships for all traits. Moreover, genomic variances explained by functional category and MAF class differed greatly among the traits studied in joint analysis. For example, exon regions had larger contributions for BFT (0.13 ± 0.08) and MS (0.22 ± 0.08), whereas intron and intergenic regions explained most of the total genomic variances for CWT and EMA (0.22 ± 0.09-0.32 ± 0.11). Considering different functional classes of exon regions and the per SNP contribution revealed the largest proportion of genetic variance was attributable to synonymous variants. GWAS detected 206 and 27 SNPs in genic and exon regions, respectively, on BTA4, BTA6, and BTA14 that were significantly associated with CWT and EMA. These SNPs were harbored by 31 candidate genes, among which , and  were noteworthy. BayesR analysis found that most SNPs (>93%) had very small effects and the 4.02-6.92% that had larger effects (10 ×  , 10 ×  , and 10 ×  ) explained most of the total genetic variance, confirming polygenic components of the traits studied.'} |
| Lifestyle interventions, including exercise and dietary supplementation, can modify DNA methylation and exert health benefits; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we investigated the impact of acute aerobic exercise and the supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on global and gene-specific (PPARGC1A, IL6 and TNF) DNA methylation, and DNMT mRNA expression in leukocytes of disease-free individuals. Eight trained male cyclists completed an exercise test before and after a four-week supplementation of n-3 PUFA and EVOO in a double-blind, randomised, repeated measures design. Exercise triggered global hypomethylation (Pre 79.2%; Post 78.7%; p = 0.008), alongside, hypomethylation (Pre 6.9%; Post 6.3%; p < 0.001) and increased mRNA expression of PPARGC1A (p < 0.001). Associations between PPARGC1A methylation and exercise performance were also detected. An interaction between supplement and trial was detected for a single CpG of IL6 indicating increased DNA methylation following n-3 PUFA and decreased methylation following EVOO (p = 0.038). Global and gene-specific DNA methylation associated with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The supplementation of EVOO reduced DNMT1 mRNA expression compared to n-3 PUFA supplementation (p = 0.048), whereas, DNMT3a (p = 0.018) and DNMT3b (p = 0.046) mRNA expression were decreased following exercise. In conclusion, we demonstrate that acute exercise and dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs and EVOO induce DNA methylation changes in leukocytes, potentially via the modulation of DNMT mRNA expression. Future studies are required to further elucidate the impact of lifestyle interventions on DNA methylation. |
| The FABP4 and FABP5 genes, coding for fatty acid transport proteins, have long been studied as positional candidate genes for SSC4 QTL affecting fat deposition and composition traits in pigs. Polymorphisms in these genes, FABP4:g.2634_2635insC and FABP5:g.3000T>G, have previously been associated with fatness traits in an Iberian by Landrace cross (IBMAP). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the functional implication of these genetic variants. For this purpose, FABP4 and FABP5 mRNA expression levels in 114 BC1_LD animals (25% Iberian × 75% Landrace) were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR in backfat and muscle. FABP4 gene expression in backfat, but not in muscle, was associated with FABP4:g.2634_2635insC. In contrast, FABP5:g.3000T>G was not associated with gene expression levels. An expression-based genome-wide association study highlighted the FABP4:g.2634_2635insC polymorphism as the polymorphism most associated with FABP4 gene expression in backfat. Furthermore, other genomic regions associated in trans with the mRNA expression of FABP4 in backfat and FABP5 in muscle were also identified. Finally, two putative transcription binding sites for PPARG and NR4A2 may be affected by the FABP4:g.2634_2635insC polymorphism, modifying FABP4 gene expression. Our results reinforce FABP4 as a candidate gene for fatness traits on SSC4. |

| The association of the variable rs1801282 locus of the PPARG2 gene (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications was analyzed in inhabitants of the Republic of Bashkortostan. The genotype frequencies of the variable rs1801282 locus of the PPARG2 gene did not significantly differ in groups of healthy persons and patients with type 2 diabetes in all three considered inheritance models (codominant, dominant, and recessive). At the same time, it was demonstrated that the risk of one of the diabetic complications, i.e., diabetic nephropathy, was associated with the variable rs1801282 locus of the PPARG2 gene. Diabetic nephropathy was more common in patients with the C/C genotype (62.7%) compared to the C/G and G/G genotypes (37.5%), P = 0.036.

| Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is a key aspect of pork quality. Elucidation of intramuscular adipocyte regulation mechanisms is important for improving IMF content. Intramuscular adipocytes are dispersed among muscle fibers, so they are inclined to be affected by muscle-derived factors. Interleukin-15 is a major muscle-secreted factor. In this study, the genetic and physiological impacts of IL15 on adipogenesis is investigated. The promoter region of IL15 was scanned by comparative sequencing using two DNA pools of high- and low-IMF individuals. Two SNPs, c.-342C>T (ss2137497757) and c.-334G>A (ss2137497756) (the translation start site is designated as +1), were identified with reverse allele distribution in these two groups. Genotyping by allele-specific PCR revealed that the two SNPs were completely linked. The IMF content of TA/TA individuals was lower than that for CG/CG ones, whereas the IL15 expression level was higher in T-A/T-A individuals. Luciferase assaying also revealed that the T-A haplotype promoter had higher transcription activity. Meanwhile, the effect of interleukin-15 on adipocyte differentiation was further assessed in vitro. Results showed that interleukin-15 suppressed preadipocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The cell cycle of preadipocytes was arrested, and apoptosis was induced. Oil Red O staining and triglyceride quantification indicated that adipocyte differentiation was also inhibited by interleukin-15. The mRNA levels of PPARG and FABP4 decreased markably upon interleukin-15 treatment. Taken together, we identified two completely linked SNPs in the porcine IL15 promoter region that could alter IL15 transcription activity. As interleukin-15 can inhibit porcine adipocyte differentiation, these promoter mutations could affect IMF deposition by producing differential levels of muscle-derived interleukin-15. |
| In recent years, there have been an increasing number of genetic variants associated with athletic phenotypes. Here, we selected a set of sports-relevant polymorphisms that have been previously suggested as genetic markers for human physical performance, and we examined their association with athletic status in a large cohort of Brazilians. We evaluated a sample of 1,622 individuals, in which 966 were nonathletes, and 656 were athletes: 328 endurance athletes and 328 power athletes. Only the AGT M268T minor allele was nominally associated with the endurance status. Conversely, we found that seven polymorphisms are more frequent in power athletes (MCT1 D490E, AGT M268T, PPARG P12A, PGC1A G482S, VEGFR2 Q472H, NOS3 C/T, and ACTN3 R577X). For all of these polymorphisms, power athletes were more likely than nonathletes or endurance athletes to carry the major allele or the homozygous genotype for the major allele. In particular, MCT1 D490E, AGT M268T, NOS3 C/T, and ACTN3 R577X showed stronger associations. Our findings support a role for these variants in the achievement of power athletic status in Brazilians: MCT1 D490E (T allele), AGT M268T (G allele), PPARG (C allele), PGC1A G482S (C allele), VEGFR2 Q472H (T allele), NOS3 C/T (T allele), and ACTN3 R577X (R allele). |
| Gene regulatory analysis of highly diverse human tissues in vivo is essentially constrained by the challenge of performing genome-wide, integrated epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis in small selected groups of specific cell types. Here we performed genome-wide bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq from the same small groups of bronchial and alveolar cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from flash-frozen lung tissue of 12 donors and their peripheral blood T cells. Methylation and transcriptome patterns differed between alveolar and bronchial cells, while each of these epithelia showed more differences from mesodermally-derived T cells. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between alveolar and bronchial cells tended to locate at regulatory regions affecting promoters of 4,350 genes. A large number of pathways enriched for these DMRs including GTPase signal transduction, cell death, and skeletal muscle. Similar patterns of transcriptome differences were observed: 4,108 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in GTPase signal transduction, inflammation, cilium assembly, and others. Prioritizing using DMR-DEG regulatory network, we highlighted genes, e.g., ETS1, PPARG, and RXRG, at prominent alveolar vs. bronchial cell discriminant nodes. Our results show that multi-omic analysis of small, highly specific cells is feasible and yields unique physiologic loci distinguishing human lung cell types in situ. |

| We aimed to examine the molecular basis of the positive effect of resveratrol against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive impairment (CI), and depression induced by a mixture of bisphenol A (BPA), BPS, and BPF. The CTD, GeneMania, Metascape, SwissADME, Cytoscape, MIENTURNET, miRNAsong, and Autodock Vina were the fundamental tools for analysis. Resveratrol exerts its protective effects on selected diseases induced by a mixture of BPA, BPS, and BPF through the following genes: PTGS2 and GSR for ALS; INS, IL6, BDNF, and SOD1 for PD; BDNF, CASP3, TNF, INS, IGF1, IL1B for CI; and BDNF, PTGS2, and IL6 for depression. Detoxification was noted as the most important for ALS, dopamine metabolism for PD, apoptosis for CI, and the selenium micronutrient network for depression. hsa-miR-377-3p, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p, and hsa-miR-204-5p were highlighted. We created and tested in silico sponges that inhibited these miRNAs. NFE2L2, BACH1, PPARG, and NR4A3 were listed as the key transcription factors implicated in resveratrol's protective effect against harmful studied chemicals. Furthermore, resveratrol's physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics are consistent with its therapeutic benefits in ALS, PD, CI, and depression, owing to its high gastrointestinal absorption, drug-likeness, non-P-glycoprotein substrate, and capacity to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. |
| The aim of this study was to determine the chemical structure and mechanism of action of Euryale ferox Salisb (ES) in the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The TCMSP, SymMap V2, CTD, DisGeNET, and GeneCards databases were searched for ES components, targets, and DKD targets using the network pharmacology method to identify common drug-disease targets. PPI analysis was used to identify hub genes, which were then followed by DKD clinical relevance, GO, KEGG analysis, and transcription factor prediction. Finally, molecular docking was performed. We discovered 24 components of ES and 72 objectives of ES, 9 of which were clinically relevant and primarily regulated by transcription factors such as HNF4A and PPARG. They are involved primarily in signal transduction, inflammatory responses, TNF regulation, apoptosis, MAPK, and other signaling pathways. The main components are oleic acid targeting the protein encoded by PPARA, LPL, FABP1, and vitamin E binding the protein encoded by MAPK1, TGFB1. In general, this approach provides an effective strategy in which ES acts primarily against DKD through oleic acid and vitamin E, targeting the protein encoded by PPARA, LPL, FABP1, MAPK1 to regulate TNF, apoptosis, MAPK, and other signaling pathways. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Euryale ferox Salisb (ES) is well known for its use in medicine and food. Furthermore, ES contains many nutrients, whose pharmacological properties, including antidepressant, antioxidant, and anti-diabetic action, have been extensively demonstrated by numerous studies. In this article, through network pharmacology combined with clinical correlation analysis and molecular docking, the target and mechanism of ES in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) were discussed, which clarified its mechanism at the molecular level.

| Triphenyltin (TPT) is an endocrine contaminant that is often detected in the environment. However, the mechanism of the effects of TPT on biological systems is not fully understood. Here we exposed marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) to TPT for 21 days. Brain transcriptome, intestinal content metabolism group, and behavior analysis were carried out. Through the comprehensive analysis of multiomics for the in-depth understanding of the ways related to health improvement, we determined that the glycine-serine-threonine metabolic axis was most perturbed by TPT. Through behavioral analysis, it was found that there was behavioral hyperactivity in the exposed group; behavioral hyperactivity may be caused by the interference of TPT with the neuroendocrine system. In order to gain a full understanding of the impacts of TPT on human health, transcriptomic screening of differential genes and an impartial attitude based on bioinformatics were used. Gene-disease interaction analysis using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) revealed the possible effects of TPT on human health. Finally, based on these findings, the relevant adverse outcome pathway (AOP), which is the "epigenetic modification of PPARG leading to adipogenesis," was identified from AOP Wiki. Further research is required to validate the potential AOP of TPT. |
| Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) are new environmental pollutants that attracted increased attention. At present, the effects and underlying mechanisms of action of combined exposure of DEHP and PS-MPs on the kidney have not been elucidated. To investigate the renal toxicity of DEHP and PS-MPs exposure, we established single and combined DEHP and PS-MPs exposure models in mice and HEK293 cells, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining, transmission electron microscopy, monodansylcadaverine staining, immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis and other methods were used to detect relevant indicators. The results showed that the expression levels of ROS/AMPK/ULK1 and Ppargc1α/Mfn2 signaling pathway-related genes were significantly increased in the DEHP and PS-MPs exposure models. The mRNA and protein expression levels of autophagy markers were also upregulated. In addition, we found that the expression levels of mRNAs and proteins in the combined exposure group were more significantly increased than those in the single exposure group. In conclusion, combined exposure to DEHP and PS-MPs caused oxidative stress and activated the AMPK/ULK1 pathway, thereby inducing renal autophagy. Our results enhance the field of nephrotoxicity studies of plasticizers and microplastics and provide new light on combined toxicity studies of DEHP and PS-MPs. |

| FAM129B is one of Niban-like proteins described in neoplastic cells and implicated in melanoma cell invasion, but no reports have been published on FAM129B and cell differentiation. We show that FAM129B is early and transiently expressed and crucial for 3T3-F442A adipogenesis. Fam129b is expressed downstream of the early genes Cebpb, Klf4, Klf5 and Srebf1a, but upstream of Pparg2 since knockdown of Fam129b blocked Pparg2 expression and adipose differentiation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta activity, a crucial kinase for adipogenesis, and the ERK1/2 are involved in FAM129B phosphorylation as part of the adipogenic program. Phosphorylated FAM129B is crucial for Pparg2 expression and the lipogenic gene expression downstream of Pparg2, and hence for adipogenesis. Fam129b knockdown reduced adipocyte cluster formation and size, regulating commitment and clonal amplification. In vivo, BAT, inguinal and epidydimal fat expressed Fam129b, suggesting a role in adipose tissue development. We conclude that FAM129B is a cooperative protein that regulates differentiation during the early stages of adipogenesis. |

| SIRT3 is a protein lysine deacetylase with a prominent role in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, which is a vulnerable target in many diseases. Intriguingly, cellular aging is reversible just by SIRT3 overexpression, which raises many questions about the role of SIRT3 in the molecular anti-aging mechanisms. Therefore, functions of SIRT3 were analyzed through the interaction network of 407 substrates collected by data mining. Results of the pathway enrichment and gene function prediction confirmed functions in the primary metabolism and mitochondrial ATP production. However, it also suggested involvement in thermogenesis, brain-related neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's, Huntington's disease (HD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The protein node prioritization analysis identified subunits of the complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) as the nodes with the main regulatory effect within the entire interaction network. Additional high-ranked nodes were succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB), complex II, and ATP5F1, complex V of MRC. The analysis supports existence of the NADH/NAD+ driven regulatory feedback loop between SIRT3, complex I (MRC), and acetyl-CoA synthetases, and existence of the nuclear substrates of SIRT3. Unexplored functions of SIRT3 substrates such as LMNA and LMNB; HIF-1a, p53, DNA-PK, and PARK7 are highlighted for further scientific advances. SIRT3 acts as a repressor of BACE1 through the SIRT3-LKB1-AMPK-CREB-PGC1A-PPARG-BACE1 (SIRT3-BACE1), which functions are fitted the best by the Circadian Clock pathway. It forms a new working hypothesis as the therapeutical target for AD treatment. Other important pathways linked to SIRT3 activity are highlighted for therapeutical interventions. |

| To estimate the associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and methylation of SLC30A8 gene and T2DM risk, and the interactions among SNPs, methylation, and environmental factors on T2DM risk. We genotyped 9 SNPs and tested methylation at 46 CpG loci of SLC30A8 in the baseline DNA of 290 T2DM cases and 290 matched controls nested in the Rural Chinese Cohort Study. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate the associations between SNPs and SLC30A8 methylation and T2DM risk. Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis was used to estimate the effect of interactions among SNPs, methylation, and environment on T2DM risk. Probability of T2DM was decreased with rs11558471 (GG vs. AA, OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32, 0.96), with rs13266634 (TT vs. CC, OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32, 0.94), with rs3802177 (AA vs. GG, OR = 0.54, 95%CI 0.31, 0.94), and its probability was increased with rs2466293 of SLC30A8 (GA vs. AA, OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.08-2.47). Its probability was also significantly associated with methylation of CG9 and CG45 (OR = 0.56 [95% CI 0.33-0.97] and 1.61 [95%CI 1.03--2.51]).
