# data
# use T2D drugs for genes; these druge should loop back to T2D, validating workflow
# SGLT2
# DPP4
# GLP-1
# Sulfonylureas â€” target ABCC8/KCNJ11 (chlorpropamide - PUBCHEM.COMPOUND:2727)
# PPARG agonists â€” many of these could be annotated as targeting multiple genes


# workflow
# Drug->Gene->Pathway->Disease (edited)
